this only serves to aggravate the anti-democratic nature of the european union , and i hope mr moscovici has clearly understood that mr prodi has today a bulwark against erected veritable these actions . furthermore , i very much hope that trend will at the councils in nice and adjourned in reversed biarritz . 
these negotiations , we know , are very difficult , and a failure or a minimal agreement some concern in nice , even worse , you have already agreed , mr president-in-office . 
any other way of doing things would lead to a democratic deficit must be said . 
mr president , mr president prodi , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i thank the european parliament delegation to the convention and the president of this one , for their committed work . roman herzog 
mr. president , i ask you , very seriously , to reflect on the following : if you take refuge behind the decision in cologne and don &apos;t want envisage integration of the charter into the treaties with the greatest difficulty eventual encouragement those who violate human rights , where is the benefit of our procrastination victims of this disaster ? 
but here i wish to express , at least to prevent a disagreement , differences of opinion on two points . 
he was right to emphasise what has happened in the meantime the wall and the unity of germany , there are ten years &apos; time . 
it has also made a suggestion as regards the connection of the charter with the extremely interesting article 7 . discussion of a possible 
this work possible , and the study by the european university institute in florence is an excellent basis to draw it up in an efficient manner . 
here , mr moscovici , nor do i believe we must move from the eu agenda . the case of any 
however , right now , though we note that president putin , has a policy of opening up towards the west .

at the same time , the introduction of buses on bigger dimensions should reduce the number of buses are added in circulation , which would do further damage the environment less . 
we took the risk capital resources is very dangerous . 
in reality , entrepreneurs are more often than not comparable with players who are hoping to touch the golden goose yalta did . 
but is precisely on the right of ownership , on freedom of enterprise , which will hit the minority of capital , which possesses the right to exploit that advantage . to use or 
mr. president , i abstained on the resolution on the charter of fundamental rights of the european union because i find this charter , despite some remains unsatisfactory advanced . 
as a member of the european parliament delegation to this house , and after working with my colleagues for eight months on the subject , i must say that the charter of fundamental rights , indeed , the added value would have been able to play for a europe that , in the current state of affairs , but you cannot be satisfied with its content , nor of working methods that have led to some appropriate ni its formulation . 
the group the csu in the european parliament agrees with the provisions horizontal which specifies that , no new competence is being created does not in fact to the community and for the union . 
because we believe that the constituent process of europe deserves a genuine public and democratic debate , there cannot be a political construction of europe with no social rights or democracy . 
that concludes the vote . 
( a5-0249 / 00 ) by mr poos , on cyprus . &#91; com ( 1999 / 2000 - 1997 / 2171 ( cos vote ) 502 97 ) ) ; 
i am convinced that some countries will be able to carry out the preparations in this period of time . made sufficient 
the french presidency will inform the commission immediately , mr brok , that you are president of the outcome of these negotiations as early as on tuesday afternoon , as is the custom here between us . from now 
we are counting in effect , in complete agreement with commissioner verheugen , begin negotiations , which means that it would be out of 42 new chapters from 4 to nine , depending on the countries , just as the portuguese presidency , before us . 
but the date of 1 january 2003 , which is the only way if the union to be agreed , is , for the candidates and for us , an objective very ambitious and it is with this in mind that the presidency will use all its efforts . 
i am quite happy , of course , to follow the very important debate which we are to meet it today . 
the current enlargement process , the most important in the history of european unification , is morally and politically necessary desirable strategically achievable . 
if we can see that the countries in the process of enlargement , within a short space of time have already achieved the stability of their democratic systems , that is a situation whereby these countries have made performance themselves . 
for the eu institutions , they must be used to monitor the success of the process and to continue to develop strategies , to negotiate . 
i will mention only the environment , agriculture , regional policy , internal and legal affairs and the budget and by way of the commission is working towards a new system preparations surveillance that will enable us to assess the state of negotiations and at any time , precisely to , and the actual implementation for each country . 
mr president , mr president-in-office , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are today debating the progress of the process of enlargement of the brok report devoted to the european union - an issue which is every year . 
in our view , paragraph 25 , and the amendment that my group has tabled on this issue to be essential . 
mr chairman , mr brok &apos;s report makes an excellent description of the position of the european parliament . 
the challenge of the reunited , more than that of enlargement is so enormous that probably , all the case . this impinges or surrounds hence depth and strength of all our discussions that abound including this morning &apos;s debate on the need to prepare itself to this challenge , the ordinary . 
the important thing is not to let in amongst the candidate countries which set the frustration , remember , even if they are waiting for , is not yet in ambient precursor well into the union . engrained 
our group considers that by acting in a determined manner , it is quite possible that the first group is able to join at the point of the forthcoming elections of the european parliament , but it is necessary to act strongly made on all sides . 
the differences in relation to what is stated in the brok report , the details and affect both of the more important points . 
in all these issues , the brok report and has confined itself to be speaking in terms of adaptation , of reform . 
the personal involvement of the rapporteurs of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , as well as the discussions with him have been held , fertile who y in the same direction . unfailingly are steps 
enlargement , i have just said , it is an historic process , it is a duty . 
we are concerned here with the credibility of the union . 
create the conditions for the success , because it is important that this enlargement will not be just another , and one with which this enlargement is not just a outburst symbolic decision would , eventually , will create problems . 
none of you should only be astonished that those responsible for the negotiations , the prime ministers , the presidents of parliament , your colleagues in the national parliaments are complaining that things are not moving fast enough . and what this is really a sport valued in europe . 
we should not set a date can awaken disillusionment fix too early , that this can result in a certain amount self-satisfaction we shall look into it . in other words , then , that of the date at the appropriate time , when we shall be a sufficient one , if so , when a particular country certainty will be ready for accession should be or not . 
we have it was already very broadly . 
before i should be concerned , freedom and democracy to prevail , oppression and had taken the lunacy of war , and a european union for europe was created . if ever 
these countries are a source of culture , diversity and occurs in abundance possibilities multiple which europe does not mean simply do without . unified 
during the negotiations if estonia is a known fact , adopt a course of action which is effective and targeted way . she has a good chance of becoming one of the new member states of the union . 
the criticisms and proposals put forward in my report as to be urgent and necessary progress in human and social matters here only aim is to successfully and rapidly licences latvia into the european union . 
it is our duty to continue to support the question of integrating latvia on the russian population . 
the link that still exists between the and the dollar motto lithuanian also plays a part in such matters as there is ever the increase in the dollar against the euro has been following 
that is the only way to improve the possibility of development for kaliningrad , too . 
many of us believe that , in order to stimulate and to be able to maintain this support , it would have been helpful to living beings dates for accession . indicate 
a particular problem facing the czech republic , in particular of the border with germany , is the problem of prostitution , particularly of child prostitution . 
we are in the middle of a process of negotiation . 
the problems i referred to . in this you are not insurmountable . 
these policies have to lead to a free , not instead of forced assimilation , individuals belonging to this community . 
the resolution and the report we are relevant to focus on some of the most controversial issues , and that is the nuclear safety , border controls , the treatment of minorities and the problem of corruption . 
perhaps now is not a coincidence that this same public survey reveals that the ambassador to the european union is the second most popular personality in romania it today . 
mr. president , commissioner , shares the opinion of the commission report which your rapporteur on slovenia , and would point out that the criticism voiced in 1998 for the authorities have formed a salutary shock slovenes , who have since then by speeding up the adoption of the measures needed reacted for accession . 
the continuation of the status quo , the outcome of the turkish invasion in 1974 , is unacceptable for july / august the european union . 
it was only logical that the helsinki european council in december of last year , gave the go-ahead , in the context of the extension of the accession negotiations , to the resumption of negotiations with malta . 
the tendency in this report can be seen in that way to encourage the adaptation to speed up the politicians polish lawful to implement the acquis of the eu and , as well as the conclusion , a few days ago , of the agreement on the liberalisation of agricultural market in this respect . positive signs polish emit 
on this point , it has the support of the commission . 
let me turn to take priority . a few elements 
that is why we can , for we do more and more honesty , draw up in these areas . 
fundamentally , we are now considering , at one point : the huge efforts the applicant countries for enlargement to , and the absolute desire to add the european union must be sufficient grounds for us prepare ourselves for this . 
mr president , we have perhaps been a tendency to think that the accession of new member states that these customs services must meet supposes automatically standards protecting the environment and of nature . 
mr president , when all the ills of boxes , and opened pandora sa humanity freed . totality - 
hence my report focuses a great part of its recommendations to the need to go more in the field of the phare programme to be done , the health and to bring the countries to cooperate from now on the framework of programmes of action on health and in other sectors . 
we must start to speak of european development . ( pt ) this integrated and polycentric yalta did . 
( fr ) we have heard on the theme of the carrot with regard to the sector of policy and their regional funding policy . 
there are a number of other points mentioned by the committee on regional policy in his report . 
in order to avoid the repetition same , it is essential to see to it that enlargement is not only beneficial to humans , but also only to women . 
the fact that people are more susceptible counterbalanced hours is just one proof , i warned earlier in the same terms of the colleagues in central europe – that we have moved from a to reality honeymoon normally holds . 
the outcome of the intergovernmental conference , the conditions for the european union depend unavoidable undertake enlargement . 
the group of the greens / european free alliance also speaks in favour of the conclusion of negotiations with the first group of applicant countries at the end of 2002 , so that the first accessions take place before next european election in 2004 . ( da ) the agencies are able to 
the various reports are expressions of this opinion which matters most . 
which have just emerged from your old jail , step in a new one . wasn go 
i believe that by moving too quickly , then to six-party already fifteen , we have demonstrated our inability to build a europe which respects the disparities in the very early days state level . 
we will see a strengthening of competition and acceleration of the reforms , including in western europe . 
at various stages , however , measures were taken , during and after the second world war , which do not correspond to the copenhagen criteria , obviously , not given the spirit which prevailed to then , but , whatever the case , either , which is on these laws which architecture ideological and was politics of that period , including the peace treaties . 
for all these reasons , in our own experience in greece , our opposition to the enlargement of the european union is the expression of solidarity towards the warring factions brotherly workers and in general to the peoples and countries seeking membership . 
it is imperative that the accession negotiations between romania and the european union very type of the romanian government has detailing for improving the standards and quality of the need of it in that country . orphanages 
in the report by mr gawronski for example , the commission is asked to study the appropriate measures in order to promote the development and strengthening of synergies between poland , lithuania and the region of kaliningrad . russian 
mr verheugen , as chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development , i have taken the opportunity to visit the applicant countries . 
the poos report stresses that the democracy , in cyprus , is , because the human rights can be made perfect y rights provided the basis for the social and cultural tradition , cyprus , and that the social conditions are substantially from country y centre on the human person . 
the audiovisual sector is very important . 
mr president , the debate today is on the great challenge of this change in the millennium : peace and security , to the very core of uniting europe and will favour the development in the social , economic and environmental . 
mr. president , as a member of the joint parliamentary delegation , i should like to endorse the remarks that eu-lithuania in her report . my colleague mrs hoff 
are those perpetrated on discrimination in other countries such as in poland and malta . 
it is a process to tighten up , but with greater or lesser success the bearer of great hopes for the extent that one day the union &apos;s citizens and these citizens are to result will therefore be a few words now to establish a link with namely marihuana their homelands of origin . 
therefore a case to want to replace the principle of &quot; stop each within the framework of its results &quot; with &quot; each within the framework of its results . &quot; but elections to firstly my 
his cooperation with the international community during the conflict in kosovo and was a very balanced one at that time are essential for the whole region . 
amongst these is the privatisation and restructuring efforts of the economy . 
those people are not allowed and excluded ignorant form a society of the information but which are a sign of our failure . 
member states could do more in their operations to assist the candidates for twin develop their administrative capacity . 
these parts of eastern europe are ready , cyprus . above all , like to end 
take enlargement consists of a concentration of economic resources , we must acknowledge this , but this will be able to produce , on the economy , also so as regrouping significant gains in the future either , by increasing the scale of the market and the growth in our continent . 
mr. president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the importance and scope of the historic opportunity offered to us to unite our continent in peace cannot be ignored . 
here , we must also add that we must be prepared to implement them at administrative level . 
as vice-chairman of our joint parliamentary committee , i know that the czech republic is the case in the czech republic and i assume that the same applies to other countries . 
ten years of involvement of the united germany to the european union we regard as a story of solidarity - which are now to be shared with other , even if the enlargement is not just a matter of solidarity . 
this tension makes the &quot; model eea &quot; because it rewards reasoned applicant as candidacy . 
after the horrors of two world wars and 50 years of oppression and dictatorship , in which have been trampled on communists wogau , on behalf of the class struggle , the dignity of human rights - as much as a christian day - the universal value and the environment , democracy , religious freedom there is still a great need for our continent and that part of the world . unify lastly 
it must be made clear to all the countries that join the european union will not lead directly to the coming to economic and monetary union and access to the euro zone and the deadlines are different . 
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , yesterday the president of the commission said in his speech that he who weakens a european body is weakening the whole of the european union . 
mr president , it was with enthusiasm , and , in my view with great interest , which we will endorse today , the reports on enlargement to the candidate countries , including the czech republic to which mr jürgen schröder &apos; s report . devoted 
in my opinion , and i would like to take advantage of the presence of a former prosecutor general , the commission did not say so irishman demonstrated the determination needed to that are even sort this matter . 
( a5-0257 / 2000 ) by mrs paulsen , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a european parliament and council decision on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition ( com ( 1999 ) 654 / 0259 ( cod ) &#93; / 1999 - 1999 97 
that is a point that is centrally and bulk of the work of prevention . 
they cannot actually confidence if control is subject to major differences from one member state or region to another . 
i cannot go as for myself , to sacrifice the food safety on the altar of profit by the agrifood lobby , i have withdrawn from the report . my own behalf 
when it comes to establishing the maximum values , we must bear in mind that the nature of its own laws , that the have available , and that , ultimately , encourage harvests vary farmer , because of environmental effects is suffering as there cannot be any in relation to which of influence . 
we addressed in the same way all the other areas relating to the prohibition of lessening its impact . 
this directive is the first link in a series of decisions relating to this food safety . 
of course , the zero risk is not possible . however , it is important to implement an alarm system . 
we are not disputing the paulsen report , we strongly agree with its contents . 
the commissioner should know that in my country , the advisory committee for the questions on animal feed independent that a ban on this scale is running scared , leading to a displacement of the transactions to those outside the eu where blending they have fewer chances of being both properly monitored and controlled in the union market of any future penetration ) first yalta did . 
i am pleased that the ppe-de group has withdrawn its proposal for an amendment on the problem of mad lessening its impact . 
as i see it , &apos; from farm to the expression &quot; is l of the year within 
unfortunately , in future , of criminal acts are not going to be totally ruled out , despite our efforts . 
mr president , this directive is part of the package of measures planned for in order to guarantee consistent security of all stages of the indeed have the food chain . 
if the legislation on hygiene rules is at fault in this connection , we must look at it again . 
secondly , the commission cannot accept amendment no 27 , in which parliament is proposing to delete the possibility of laying down criteria of acceptability for raw materials for food of animals has been presented to some of the processes for decontamination . 
amendments nos 39 and 40 , which propose to delete the possibility to introduce limits on action , are equally unacceptable . 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 5 and 22 , which relate to the rapid alert system as they currently stand . 
the next item is the report ( a5-0233 / 2000 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive 79 / 373 / eec on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs ( com ( 1999 ) - c5-0020 / 2000 - 2000 / ( cod ) ) . 
commissioner byrne , we are very satisfied . 
producers have a duty to prove the composition of compound feedingstuffs , should there be a request , by providing detailed information in order to shift the burden of proof in part to play down but also within member states . the efforts of the supervisory 
the question of genetically modified cereals should be settled elsewhere than here . 
the standards that are barely comparable and transferable , still less 
it is simple , but for ten years we revolves around the bush in flour . 
i envisage a more critical the protection clause to the individual , who would commission to take its own action , without of consultations with member states . commit 
based on accurate exact data forms a second phase , which is also necessary . 
thus , within the council , a very significant majority of member states does not favour the idea from compulsory indication on the label , systematic , of the composition of compound feedingstuffs specifies intended for animals of report . 
madam president , i must sadly inform you and this house on a new tragedy at sea . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
the recital text in question would therefore , i quote : &quot; whereas the recital c ) , situation of roma receives due attention , although the not always of the roma must be taken into serious discrimination account by the hungarian government , through the adoption of a set of positive measures that could lead to equality of individuals belonging to free this community , whereas it is important to find a solution through the creation of an office of the minorities and to the adoption of legislation in the medium term , which will promote the integration of measures into the society . &apos; hungarian roma 
mr. president , i would just like to say that there is no longer of all at that time but that , in recital a , there is an agreement with mr martelli &apos;s liberal socialists new article 1 . 
i voted against the brok report on the enlargement of the european union because , even if it is from a technical point of view , evidence of clear-headedness il obeys political viewpoints on the future of europe to do so . erroneous 
the extension of the union , at least in the first step , at over ecu 100 million new citizens , will breathe new life into the development and integration of the european economy as a whole . 
his report is clearly the issues and the objectives of enlargement , in the field of regional policy , and this is happening in terms both political and economic profit . 
on preparatory measures stretching over long periods and the regulations which cover a great deal of time has been vested transitional and often necessary . 
we must provide a good answer to an enlargement which is going to significantly increase the number of disadvantaged regions , at risk from reflect jointly exacerbate imbalances in the european area in order to prevent europe from being nothing more than a vast heterogeneous whole . 
so where are the &quot; for a number of advances which have never been consulted communities that have been victims of this disaster ? 
i fear that this range of reports on countries which are becoming apparent and reports , above all in those countries which would prove a counter-productive have introduced a request for accession to the european union , especially the countries of central and eastern europe . 
and when i see what has been achieved so far in this field at the intergovernmental conference , we are unable to be proud of and we should actually be of particular to put our own house in order , instead of demanding from the applicant countries from carrying out the first steps that we do ourselves are not in a position to achieve . 
that was why , together with my fellow meps from the national front , we would like to avoid a situation in eastern europe to the nations the mistake of the union &apos; in an &quot; disintegration take yalta did . 
we need to consider , as of now , new instruments and new forms of intervention for the benefit of all the areas where it puts on infrastructure and networks of the deficiencies which are brought to our services , such as the south of italy . 
it would be desirable if the governments of the candidate countries are pursuing the reinforcement of administrative capacity , so that the acquis communautaire can be applied in those countries before accession . it was as long 
apart from that of out and more cumbersome , c &apos;est is this feeling accountants 
i take this opportunity to express my thanks for the elderly and pensioners of poland , of which some , incidentally , are organised on a party of the pensioners &apos; , similar to the pensioners &apos; party which i represent in the context of this european union . 
the restructuring of the agricultural sector in many regions appears to be in a country in which the rural population foist 38 % of total population represents 4.9 % of gdp and thors was estimated to be in agriculture is emploi % compared to 5 discrimination mechanisms 27.4 yalta did . 
mr president , i very much welcome what this house had adopted , by a majority of over 90 % , the excellent report by mr schröder , who for the second year running , describes the bene ? decrees or of human rights to international law as being opposed , and stresses that they violate the acquis communautaire and the copenhagen criteria . 
as stated by mr wiersma in his report , i would stress the progress made by the slovak republic as regards protection of minorities . 
van orden report ( a5-0241 / 2000 ) 
i welcome the report called winterbourne on romania to the european union , and i agree with most of the conclusions to the rapporteur . 
quite the contrary , i cannot wait for cyprus , but i do not accept this in our midst , particularly in paragraph 4 , impartiality and the fact that the report did not insist , at least , to the need for a political settlement before accession . 
as pointed observe m. soto , we do not expect to what we can move , and the success of the process which are easy un is far from a guarantee . 
it is essential to bring projects involving the two communities and promote the dialogue between the two sides in a new spirit of trust . 
from an economic point of view , the accession of cyprus should not pose any major problems , given that the country in question has acquired a market economy and to a high standard of living . 
mr president , whilst the pensioners &apos; party is particularly close to the health aspects of food and food , it was therefore appropriate that i voted for the report paulsen . 
these are , for example and gallons of milk that might have been contaminated by dioxin legally sound . milk diluted dans 
we must continue to denounce the violations of human rights in burma . 
those of us who are sufficiently at ease and evade the possibility to shape their own social working environment and the discrimination which certain appalling conceive difficult for it is confronted daily , in peril of their lives . sometimes 
what image of the world is a child who grow up in an environment which treat it differently from the other on the pretext that it is a girl or may have been part of an ethnic minority , or that it is or homosexual disabled victims of this disaster ? 
at previous discussions , people are suffering from families social problems , of structures that are often as they deal disabled quartier or rejected . 
they fear duty employ people with the values and beliefs which there are not permitted to give their names . 
it wanted to go in the restaurant , but has refused to the entry under the pretext that the others would do his appearance physical flee clients . 
the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights has always tried to demonstrate that this approach gave a wrong political signal , it is fragmented . ( pt ) as if there were a hierarchy of discrimination . 
the fight against discrimination concerns us all . 
parliament is going to send , through our votes , a clear message to all our people to tell them that we want to improve the result has been made in member states as regards guarantees of equal treatment , irrespective of age , race , sexual orientation . of disability or 
if this is a sample of what awaits us in future i hope many others . it will submit 
i would also like to congratulate mr mann on the outcome of her work , which is presented in this report . 
nevertheless , there is no doubt that the report presented by our colleague mr cashman contains a few good things , in particular the importance which has been made to the ngos . 
we have also decided , rightly , not to include gender discrimination in this directive because the latter is already the subject of an eu directive with individually , is to be improved upon by the commission &apos;s proposals and that is based on a legal basis on which parliament far more robust , enjoys the power of co-decision . elsewhere 
society must work out in this area between the concepts and practices . the policy to complement 
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to remind you that in europe , each time that production was the principle of the prohibition applied , at last , you then had to turn back . it happened in germany , when you wanted repress parties neo-nazis yalta did . 
the italian state president has addressed himself to this house this morning . while i have listened with interest to be saying that this union it was not the purpose to deny what is national . values 
mr. president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this week is of importance to a week ’ s debates our chamber . 
thus , for the first time , is different : there is no question of the intervention is a storm of the quality of the resources available and to verify speeches which we must insist . state aid must be monitored and their outcomes subsequently published . 
we will therefore support amendment no 18 , which urges member states to the report mann to abrogate all provisions of the penal code on discrimination against homosexuals ; constitute 
in france , many examples , are proof of this . 
with national law of the fifteen eu states &apos; rights , the discrimination , including france , in part be attributed to a socialist , the france of mr jospin , socialist . 
mr president , the vote of the directive of the council for the equal treatment at work extends the prohibition on discrimination which exceeds the racial , ethnic groups and others who are used as a springboard to discrimination and to which the article 13 are talking about . 
mr. president , commissioner , some of the debate shows , in fact , that we have here , because if we need a directive says that europe is involved in an area that manner centralizing the substance of the member states , and should be faced knowing what has happened in recent months in so many european countries - yesterday on television , needed to be left out there again a pile of about attacks on synagogues rape jewish sur foreign , and so on . we still must not of the way that europe has not come and tell cheek for daring to for a directive to combat discrimination . need can 
i still have two messages . 
i therefore believe that it is necessary to involve the public and private sectors and , in this respect , i consider that the public sector must take the lead . 
article 13 of the amsterdam treaty has been a challenge to the european union . we are entrusting to the community of specific powers to launch a whole set of actions of non-discrimination , kaleidoscopic fashion so that the same level of protection is guaranteed to all the disadvantaged groups . 
we must support amendment no 37 by the committee on employment and social affairs , which provides for derogations in the field of religion or belief in the back for those entering directly into contact with members of this belief in the framework of their education and welfare of healthcare , or such as the salaries of teachers in the schools , doctors and nurses confessional in hospitals , the persons visiting work of the detainees , the advisors and children , the elderly of life for auxiliaries , adolescents , the same way , for which these services are provided on a social level desirable by the religious fold . 
i congratulate the rapporteur and , in conclusion , i shall be voting for these reports , with the exception of point , which i have referred . 
mr. president , commissioner , the task that we work is concerned is to translate into practical policies. the article 13 of the treaty . 
i would also like to thank the committees involved for their support and cooperation for a coordinated a short space of time . opinion throughout 
there are three categories of amendments . 
the commission is willing to simplify the wording of article 5 in order that this provision should be better understood . 
we all know that this is very important , but i must point out that in some member states , the collection of this kind of data is a violation of the provisions on the protection of privacy . constitutional 
i had to respond to over 50 different amendments and , i believe points and that these amendments will be adopted during the french presidency . 
you are not allowed to claim to respect democracy and human rights , provided that you don &apos;t do what is necessary to prevent the weapons of death and the repression of falling into the wrong hands . 
it is clear that many of weapons . they also appear in the wrong hands with the activity to arms brokers . 
in this sense , the titley report has been highly successful . it also highlights not only the gaps , but also the merits of the limits of the report before us was discussed . we also welcome the code of conduct . practicality 
we continue to seek both legislation and which is much more binding and no longer been seen in the market and in current developments . the industry . 
mr. president , despite its merits indisputable , the report is therefore still a very technical and is being held in a field of safety and to a model based on the strength , giving the army to the views of the arms industry . weights disproportionate 
on the basis of this account , i would argue in favour of clarity , and in the event of a discrepancy between what criterion prevails the criteria put forward by mr titley &apos;s victims of this disaster ? 
the code has already moved to the mutual understanding between the policies of member states , it has set up an efficient consultation mechanism and the dialogue about inducement the implementation of its provisions . 
several of these projects are under way or under consideration . 
in its resolution of 18 may 2000 , parliament was determined that the project . supported its implementation has now handed launched . 
these proposals will be added to a series of other communications specialize representative to the achievement of the european research area . contributions 
that is an important role that it has to play . 
commissioner , i would like to draw your attention to one question being asked by all those who have for a very long time in research . occupied 
there are some new organisations to defend . 
but in this regard , i would nevertheless like to say to parliament until it is important that this need , which has expressed and which is , moreover , a motor of economic development and innovation in this area , is taken into account at the level of the meda programme and in all the programmes for external relations . 
and if we cannot give you , as early as today , to answer , is that i actually wanted to call upon the member states to issue guidelines , this note , for it to take a position or there will be no european research area that , at the commission &apos;s resolve . gender-free 
with regard to the ecsc , as you know that there was a programme agreement and that research will continue . 
i have to be accountable , not only to the court of auditors , the taxpayers , but first of all to the european parliament , who was instructed to monitor and approve this budget , and i think that this is my duty to speak , and my role to the moment the fact is , and which i judge to be appropriate , to do it in the transparency of consideration for the budgetary authority : the one european parliament . 
i believe that the decision is yours , your services are provided with the elements , but they must be able to find an answer . 
i believe that , of the parameters that are to be signed , 102 83 : negotiations are currently in the record . 
as a member of your house has remarked , the excise duties applied by the uk on petrol and diesel fuel used by them as are the highest in europe . however , the excise duty on fuel oil and on aviation , provided that these are being used for industrial and commercial purposes , or also for heating , excise duties , excise duty on these as well as the heavy fuel oil , remain , far below the values in the union . the highest applied 
thus , i repeat , the commission has no way that eu member states the level of excise duty . modify 
the rationale of economic thinking supports mr martin &apos;s statement . 
however , if i presented a special case illustrating his speech that of achieving a particular area , or whatever , i would be delighted to my colleague mr barnier . of the little time 
the removal of borders is certainly a significant step forward but we must , however , be able to prepare these minorities . 
this means a reduction or a gradual abolition of the activities for a range of sectors . 
how is it , if the swedish government , during its presidency , gave the show of power by taking action for the restoration of the financial aid to sweden ? ecpat chief 
deleting this aid , as a result , we would be to go against the priority that the council and parliament have had it that we in the fight against the traffic of paedophiles . 
i am much obliged to the commissioner to be taking to the issue . in short , but clear shown 
this regulation , very comprehensive , relates to a number of the regulations for hunting and 
i would like the commission gives us that the rules contained in this document , should certainly not be the case for the meat of animals for consumption within families . hunted 
i shall present to the council and the european parliament a report on implementation in the member states of the community legislation on animal welfare during transport . 
as i mentioned , the commission is working on a report on the functioning of a directive on the transportation of animals in member states . 
these criteria are currently the subject for discussion and 
with regard to these aspects , the commission has been preparing a mandate to the standards institutes in order that they should work out rules on the use of computers for long periods . 
the author is not present , question no 12 lapses . 
we must say that if we establish political contact with the governments should avoid any and about which we are radically opposed , however , the attitude with regard for human rights , those responsible and heads of government are to travel abroad . far less 
aung san suu kyi , insists that such a long and hard for dialogue should take place . 
in such circumstances , it may well be that such a mission to be able to be justified . 
the eu member states are providing the essential points of the budget of the osce , and the european commission has also provided 5m registration procedures for genetically equipment aux yalta did . 
it so happens that i was present at these elections 200 observers , who had come from here among other things with 52 countries . 
mr president , as , on the other , that have already done it today , i congratulate mr titley for his report has received . 
mr president , the european defence industry is certainly important , but peace in the world it is referred to at least as much . 
( pt ) it is certainly very confusing to seeing the european union , but are , at long last be involved now entering the production of arms . 
the trade in weapons . they are presented with the poor countries that it is the strange nature which are mainly of the countries which , for the consumers , not of any one side , cannot find money , but which to buy weapons . in other 
in his first report , the expert committee stressed that the internal control independent internal audit of the activities - even distinct totally constituted conflict – which are not to the same department . 
secondly , the european commission &apos;s proposal would have the effect of imposing on all the institutions is the obligation to nominate a auditor internally . 
parliament has not yet received this official text of the proposal but we are able to hear that there is a provisional and i hope that the text submitted to parliament , will soon be complete i also understand the wish of the commission to ensure that the text is both legally and linguistically irreproachable . 
it is also important to retain the option to appeal to an independent ex ante control , no doubt , but one that , structurally decentralized is certainly not at the head of the director-general who may find themselves is conditional on the directorate-general which is the subject of control . 
however , to date we know nothing about it , and as long as it will be the case , i would like to ask this house to accompany the process of reform of the european commission with a bit of scepticism . 
i believe that the committee on budgetary control made a serious discussion on this topic and the commission is certainly very wise if it is based in the further down this constantly competence its reforms . 
with the difference of internal audit , the financial control classic verifies already before the people of the budget procedure , and payments can be signed ne contracts have been carried out . 
there is a certain lack of interest , for which i am sure that the commissioner will take good note and we are achieving the objective of this reform at the earliest opportunity a point the report marks the beginning . hulten 
i would like to thank the two committees - the committee on budgetary control and the committee on budgets , for the debate on the one and the rapporteurs , messrs van grande intensity hulten and mr dell &apos;alba , who is unable to be present today . 
i find this approach that i regret that they did not progressing so wise them myself imagined . 
it goes without saying that we make no pretence through harmonizing legislation in matters of protection of minors , not only because , in accordance with the subsidiarity principle , each member state is sovereign in this area , but also because the cultural and , therefore , the moral and conceptions appraisals of those issues , are considerable disparities in the other . he only exists , for example , no single definition of the notion of a minor , violence , and so on . 
i believe we need to educate the children to such a thing , and it is appropriate for the latter should induce the equip their children to families who will look at what is worth the trouble and to set aside the rest . 
nevertheless , i should insist on the fact that waste should not be of equal advantage rely on just introducing filtering of mechanisms in order to ensure some affords of programmes and provide furthermore broadcasters selected programmes for their responsibilities . 
i must say , by way of conclusion , for the concern of the liberal group as compared to the growing supply of television programmes in violence and sex . implying 
that being the case it is essential that all the parties involved , beginning with the children and their parents , teachers , the countries concerned , the european union , to conclude with the african , caribbean and the producers of programmes , broadcasters discuss on this topic and learn how to behave and to react in the face of all these proposals and to the effects they can have on individuals . 
i am not trying to simplify , to generalise ni even though the time is running out in the european parliament , but the many . examples are 
however , subsidiarity must be used to do something , rather than of smokescreen yalta did . 
the objective of such a study is to assess the effectiveness of the approach proposed , an approach based on the principles of self-regulation , and my services have just demonstrated in the work and provided a questionnaire to the member states . 
nobody has more respect than i am to mrs reding and the personnel in the committee . she moving constantly so i am sure that , when she will answer this evening , she is able to clarify the points that i have raised and that it rather than being just make a statement prepared . 
it is the reason why the question of the researchers must be maintained , mr evans . 
it would be wrong , i believe , that the commission have now , in private . 
i am very satisfied that the rapporteur has taken account of the possibilities of the citizens of the candidate countries to be affected by the recommendations with regard to issues of mobility . 
in spite of certain opinions of the courts , the recommendations of the commissioners and the actions carried out at council level , nothing has been done to resolve the situation of the statute has been reduced , including my readers by the italian minister for education . 
mrs reding , philippe busquin and his directorate-general , however , are , nor that of the training of researchers , neither of the problem of the recognition of training for senior cycles nor of doctors . 
mr president , colleagues , thank you , firstly to the rapporteur , but also to all those who are committed , within the competent committee and in this chamber , to ensure that mobility will become reality . 
our heads of state and government , the regional governments , national , we found out that education has a role to play if we want to develop the economic , if we want to develop the social . 
mr president , this is a great honour for me to welcome you to the european parliament . 
once again we are going to steer the fate of our continent , had to do so . ( pt ) as the larger statesmen 1950s . 
economic recovery european an established fact . let us then use the current weakness of the euro , which promotes the superb competitiveness price , to help in the productivity that innovation can create both in terms of instruments and ways of organising the production and markets . 
and by means of this is so very conquest acquired that awareness of the expansion will weakening generations , from now on , both individuals do not recognise that this europe , composed of interdependence and open borders . 
this sector nascent opens a wider access to women in working life . 
the second theme of this conference of ministers on the relationship between work and will bear a working life . 
first of all , the employment guidelines , this time have now been equipped with quantified objectives , so it is therefore proposed to raise the employment rate for women to 60 % by 2010 . 
the expectations of society are strong , and i do not get through the members of the convention that have been happier with a charter &apos; . &quot; correctness 
the participation of women in the labour market is much shorter than that of men , this difference is in some countries , especially within accentuating southern europe . 
i happen to a man , but in the european union , the men and women do not have the same chance of success . 
this deserves to be emphasized in the house . perhaps 
mainstreaming has been quoted several times here . i can only endorse what has been said that , at the level of economic policy for example , it is essential to put ourselves in thinking about &apos; aspect yalta did . between men and women 
women , both of employment with a choice of the nature , is the question which bears the future of humanity in its own territory . 
it is all well and good , at the same , the women who 
the report before us is based , however , on an interpretation of the principle of equality . fully-contrived 
the human being ) , which is a creature independent and responsible in its relations with , on the one hand of god , and on the other , obviously - its creator . they are our fellow human beings . 
it is three years since then . 
with a percentage of women , by 30 % , the european parliament is running ahead of the other institutions . 
in almost all sectors of activity , there is still profound inequalities . 
i thank her for her great commitment and her work in favour of gender equality . thoughtful 
women are forced to temporary work , debates and which is most heavily to insecure employment and unemployment , paid , on average 30 % less than men . 
that is why we must assess the true situation of women , we need to develop indicators , we must continue to give a binding force , on which account for our political action and not only to benefit all the progress that a few . 
( fr ) it is obvious , and that i am one - since tropospheric voluntary organisations too , like many of you , i have a line of action , with over 30 years - for a topical associative movements associative movements surely realise how feminists movements intellectuals , of course , are pushing forward this matter , and we worked for , at the moment , we are on our place in our role of responsibility , institutional role . 
i have not given up hope , even so , to improve this text . 
i completely support the observations of the report and the suggestions by honourable members who have spoken about the need to change the nature of the report . 
mr. president , commissioner , this morning , we shall be voting on the council common position , through which we will adopt a definitive reform of the code customs community effects . 
finally , amendment no 11 , calling for this amendment to the community customs code in force between by 1 january 2000 , has now become pointless . 
i believe that , once again , the conciliation procedure , the agreement between the institutions , has worked . 
the community customs code has enabled us to harmonise and simplify the legislation in a transparent manner , and which must always be the ultimate goal . 
given the delicate balance that characterises the whole subject , i think that the end of a conciliation procedure , on the assumption that this debate be extended - would be , rather , is uncertain . 
mr president , with regard to the last vote , i would simply like to inform the house that the commission published yesterday , a press release and that commissioner reding has already found expression in a way that , with regard to yesterday evening , the report that has just been adopted on the mobility of teachers , students and teachers and members of the educational community generally , to help them to report . first , to study and work in europe to travel for all activities linked to the territory of the conduct or vote on the commission will not accept any of the amendments and he was asked to do anything to ensure that these agreements are respected . 
mr president , it is also about issuing a translation error which has not the same level as that which has just been held responsible . 
we , the liberal group , support to this fact - and in improving the functioning of the internal market - the submission from beneficial , however , the committee on legal affairs to the commission , for them to prepare a proposal concerning a legislative &apos;s birthplace debt customs 
this proposal if it is a step in the right direction , not least with loopholes wasn consists uphold under the evans report remedies yalta did . 
our position on the recommendation of the european parliament and the council concerning the free movement within the union is positive , but we wish to on principle invoked on the following : 
we should incorporate in the association agreements which have been made , or will have to be reached between the european union and the candidate countries of the rules which prohibit the discrimination of protected by article 13 . group 
the usual principles of the rule of law are thus going little by little organisms under the influence of a vision of the fight against discrimination , to which the european parliament and commission are too happy to throw its nose into the law to put their national . 
i deemed it important to me , however , to broaden the scope of the programme in order to ensure the implementation of article 13 of the treaty . 
in addition , the snp regard this directive as a means of attaining the underlying objectives of the european union in the field of employment it amongst recognizing that allows us to combat social exclusion and participates in the mobility of citizens more in the union . 
this is already very difficult for the authorities . 
this is an area that is very complex and the proposals are both ambitious and extremely important . 
but also discriminating against the people and professional organisations as an expression of a recital , the bible , the rule for the floor divine infallible governing all else , faithful to those who employ binding etuc propagandise sexually completely at odds with that declare ethics of holy writ . 
this distinction is harmful to the transparency of the financial regulation . 
despite the fact that we had a great liking over against the idea of a political direction of european production and export of arms , on that we are sceptical of the titley report , above all for the following reasons : 
i support the report by my colleague gary titley , and consider as him that the commercial practices which are responsible for the field of armaments , are part of the community acquis and , consequently , the applicant countries should be involved in the development of the code of conduct on arms exports , code of conduct which should be legally binding . 
the european states have been selling arms to indonesia whose army is involved in the massacres in east , to the moluccas . 
once again we are seeing this difficult and sensitive issue of protecting our children - which will become of tomorrow &apos;s society , is becoming the object of particular , with a view to commercialising even stepped up . 
minors are different adults . 
i stick personally so that , at european level , would entail the union &apos; s governments are putting into place the appropriate legislation in order to set up the mechanisms of the necessary protection that i am proposing here . 
the 1998 report examines in particular , the phenomenon of unemployment and economic impact of women . underemployment 
we want equal opportunities in employment , in the participation of social and health and indeed elsewhere , can only take place in a context of policies which , overall , reactionaries necessarily damage human dignity , without the prospect of a society of unemployment , underemployment , equity social welfare state , one firm sans charging and human dignity . chief 
b5-0784 / 2000 by mr salafranca sánchez-neyra , on behalf of the group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on the crisis situation in peru ; 
the support that the usa have given to this man has been in the way of these aspirations are , and this influence has to be , by another , whether positive neutralised influence on the part of the european union , this one , in favour of human rights and full development of democracy . 
it is appropriate that the european union took an active and to do it quickly . 
that is why the commission to study at the moment with the member states how can any practical aid can flow in the best possible conditions as regards plans for the preparation of a pluralistic and democratic elections and of their control . 
the basic political problem , to quote the resolution . it is just as the surest way of trying to influence the situation in afghanistan , then that is , to put pressure on the very large neighbour , pakistan , and i would add , the people &apos;s republic of china &apos; s other main neighbour themselves work , with whom pakistan enjoys excellent relations , with whom we , at the level in terms of military collaborates pakistan nuclear . 
the resolution drawn up by all the groups , and i have the honour of seizing a step in the right direction . 
the ? u at again would do a good impression , if she were brought in a political initiative in the united nations , roads in order to reach a peaceful resolution of conflicts in afghanistan . 
the urgent resolution , who is now put to the vote , ask that the concerns expressed by this parliament on many occasions , to be translated into concrete initiatives . 
the thorny question before us now is whether this is enough for a front barbarity religious create oppositional internationale contre jihad the hosts , osama bin laden . behalf of the union for europe 
as human rights are 
at present , for example , a priest colombian medina , is located in brazil . 
in this regard , i would like to emphasize that the commission supports the peace efforts of president pastrana and is doing everything in its power to foster a lasting peace in colombia . 
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that this resolution is important because it talks about a positive decision by the macedonian government and , unfortunately , not of all the political forces of macedonia , higher education on the law concerning who is going to make it possible for young people of the minorities and especially ultimately of the albanian minority , to study in their mother tongue . 
to an extraordinary , this cooperation that led to a draft law which was approved in parliament by a majority in parliament . 
mr. president , i add my voice to that of willingly joost trumpet lagendijk for mr van der stoel . 
mr president , at the reconciliation between germany and france , as general de gaulle has been talk of &apos; peace of the brave &apos; vote , a compromise can be maintained by those listening patriots on both sides . 
the implementation of appropriations is provided for in the proposed funding , which is being submitted today - perhaps at the moment - to the management committee precisely phare . 
it is striking to note that the shipping company ’ s government and is determined to affirm that the &quot; all the safety requirements . &quot; respected 
mr papoutsis gave already &quot; dismantled &quot; something important to the leadership of his ministry , the inspection of ships to be traded . 
i hope that , today , and that over the coming days and weeks , the commission will make the measures they intend to take against member states who are doing in the field of maritime safety . neglectful 
just as dangerous is the conduct of the supervisory authorities and of the classification society , which , by functioning as a private company for profit , is in fact can be monitored by the same as it is supposed to ship-owners monitor . 
the first one has been a problem ; even having king greek bavarian translates even today in the sense that a particularly important to travel to in that marvellous bavarian holiday country . 
the relevant member of the commission , the vice-president , mrs de palacio , has , therefore , going to take on in its 2001 work programme to the question of a revision of the directive into force as regards the safety standards for ships used to transport passengers . 
the next item is the statement by the high representative for the common foreign and security policy on the situation in the middle east peace process and on the elections in yugoslavia . 
let us hope that over the next few hours , i shall be able to give you a better , but unfortunately i cannot put it at the moment . 
the serbian people will then have the possibility to do on this part of the family of nations of europe and to work with its neighbours to the construction of a peaceful and stable . 
but was not a failure , camp david , either . the gap between the parties have been reduced dramatically and some were overcome . taboos themes which are difficult 
like other speakers , i would like to express my concern about what goes on and i would like to state that , in parallel to that region , once you begin to talk this gives the impression of the start and , where offends , or we might say , we can feel certain of obtaining of reaction . 
it was expected , for a long time , been an explosion , difficult to believe in peace simple one ; while the signing , on the settlers have fallen from more than 200 000 000 and 141 . when there is no work in order to feed its children , as my friend who is in the settlements , maybe over bricklayer une earth who belonged to his family and also by the soldiers from you is when is mobile . do not allow you 
the latest reports i have received - and i regret having to leave the house in order to travel to paris , indicate that the parliament building immediate – with the demonstrators to belgrade and the premises of television in the hands of the opposition . currently are 
it is absolutely essential to a way out of a dangerous impasse in which each partner to regard as the sovereignty of the other on unthinkable the holy places who are already forbidden . him 
israel should not only be convicted if leaders palestinians continue to use violence as an option in the negotiations . 
we can only hope that all those members of the army and police - in short , all these are men who are there to serve the people , not by them as a dictator , milosevic – and not to , may yet think better of it going to do anything against the peaceful demonstrators . 
( fr ) we have always been my objective , and i subscribe to them - of a news yugoslavia , a yugoslavia , kosovo and montenegro with states autonomous , but we must not see a new , a new , a new dispute dislocation conflict ; a new , but it is not our violence on the contrary , a goal . new yugoslavia must be obtained , a yugoslavia , where the democratic and not in the peoples , voluntarily , still remain , not with the brutal constraint , but because they are convinced of the possibility of a federation with a democratic future , to be brought about a democratic future with other leaders , which could , without , in that case they milosevic brought before the european court of justice - be made still unresolved in the hague , because we want the law , but peace . i have enjoyed with the justice

statement by the president of yugoslavia 
thank you , mr rübig . 
before making some specific comments on the issues arising from this proposal for a decision , i would like to express our support to this proposal as it endorses the position of parliament on the relationship between the european union and croatia . 
it has already managed to enact laws which intended objectives . these 
this is the result , we must also proceed to the value of the economy . 
we all share the view that we have to help croatia political aid , but from a political means , too , financial support for stability policy we need economic and social stability and always the latter may come about if the investment needed have been made in this area . 
a third of croatia is , and only that , after many years that this country has been able to be reunited and that democracy comes , which is introduced , which – and there must also emphasise this – has led to a change of government . peaceable 
right up in 1918 , the two regions were parties dissident of hungary with one language , culture and identity own that the public authorities that are opposed . 
mr. president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the most recent speeches , as have the proceedings of the whole day yesterday and today , have shown that despite the increase , which we all applauded necessary response , guarantees and guarantees for eib loans , in general , in particular , we believe that we have to a draft for the region and a whole has been agreement , as well as a sustainable process of reflection and carry on politics and decision , and economic policy . 
i would like to thank , on behalf of the commission , on her report on the proposal to be mr extending the guarantee given by the community to the european investment bank has to cover loans for projects in croatia . 
( the sitting was closed at seppänen ) . 
( fr ) it is on your behalf , that i should like to express our deepest condolences to their relations and extend my deepest sympathy . 
certainly , mr rübig , i shall do so . 
you are aware of the situation in gibraltar , where there is a british nuclear submarine hamstrung . 
i hope we can come back in the near future on the question of the thousands of other political prisoners in burma and to the lack of democracy that country . afflicting 
there they have done the dream of building a federal state with the president , for example , that is of spinelli transform into a constitution . the treaties we have 
does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request ? 
mr verheugen has given the impression that , in the current state of affairs , in the european union with ten countries will enter the year 2005 and he has also called into question - and this is the most serious point - the meaning of the vote of the council of ministers , the majority opinion in that we regard as fundamental to the element of nice . reform 
thank you , mrs palacio . 
in summary , we are here all the elements that recommend the rejection of the request for waiver of parliamentary immunity , as a result , by mr pacheco pereira and the socialist group joins with mr maccormick &apos; s proposal as not to support this motion for a resolution . 
we therefore demand that this system to be strengthened and that it is applied , as decided by the social affairs council to now , the problem of exclusion and poverty . 
the committee on women &apos;s rights recommends that the easy access to a system of social protection which must be offered sufficient and that is worthy of the raft of women of all ages , from all groups in society . 
i would first of all general observations on the social agenda , before returning to the various fields , in a spirit of respecting my speaking time . interchangeable for 
the social partners have committed themselves to work on this topic . 
i have also seen a high demand to define a real community strategy with regard to the environment of the work , with regard to health and safety . in particular 
mr president , i believe that some problems remain , but we will have to resolve them in the framework of the vote on amendments . 
i want to point out that every country in the eu have different traditions and ways of solving the problems that arise in the social field and in the context of employment policy , the decisions taken at the lisbon summit , this fact . are recognizing 
the concern of the general good should encourage us all to approve the proposal of including on the recitals in the regulations governing the employment and decisions of a merger , which are today of the competition . 
my name appears on the place of the report by mrs figueiredo . 
in conclusion , the objective , that is , to give impetus to the european social policy in the face of globalisation , about enlargement and the ageing population is commendable . 
our liberal colleagues and in particular , our british conservative colleagues , have tabled a number of amendments , which will mitigate the ambitions set out in this social action programme . 
a combination judicious and effective economic and financial policy is also a matter of priority for us , and , even more for expansion of the social economy and the services sector . 
all these coordinated action of social policy will also make it possible to combat poverty and social exclusion . 
- ( da ) the work begun in the social agenda must benefit from a coherent legal framework , of course , the policy of convergence and , reconciling the policies of proper co-ordination , but also on whether open legislative measures and home affairs is based , in turn when necessary , that methods follow-up complemented perfectly demanding . 
there is so far , is important not only of social policy , to calculate the cost , according to a few views in often regarded as an obstacle to the political , economic development , but it is also necessary to assess how the cost of the failure to implement this policy . 
commissioner , thank you for your interesting speech . 
the commission has defined five policy fields on now to think that we should see as having a strategic importance . 
we insist , at the same time , on the need for measures and to complement each other in such areas of elements which the economic life , participation , of the representation on equal terms , social rights , civil society , of the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes . 
this presupposes that we take up in one way in a policy that goes from the women ’ s institutions and politics , and we must also move towards a better adaptability in the field of equal opportunities . of the strategies awaited 
again i must pay for women a place that is in line with the vital importance of his mission , and i am not sure that mrs eriksson &apos;s report makes its contribution . 
the cause of women , could not but be reinforced by a decision ? 
we consider that the creation of an internet site is an extremely useful , not only because of the growing use of means , but also because it will contribute to computer familiarise women together with the new world of which they can only be excluded . 
i hope will lead to the necessary political impetus to the achievement of the programme and to the framework strategy yalta did . 
a demanding , the strategy which is well known that understands the five , and that is the participation of women central themes in economic life , in the decision-making process , to social policy , to civil society and the rights of individuals , and the new model for gender equality in the media and education . 
mr president , i very much welcome the report presented by the commission . 
i understand , in the light of recent events , that the commission decided to adopt a tougher line – and rightly so - has to be made of south korea . 
this is important because of the need for transparency . 
when a decision taken by competition policy , we must take account of its effects on social policy , structural and that is not done , ; if industrial its competition policy within the ideology unspoiled . 
as is well known , the commission opposed this merger and this triggered a wide-ranging debate on the way in which the rules of competition and are proving effective and assess the sectors of the market . calculate 
mr. president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , a thank you for the reports presented cordial today ; they do not of the past , they offer simply explain the themes of the current debate and include the commission &apos;s plans . already the 
finally , the strengthening of individual responsibility of the citizen cannot create a european policy of legal insecurity , but for competition has to determine , behaviour that outside the institutions . and the culture 
in his report mr evans would like to thank you , mr monti , for your attacked single-mindedly state aid policy . the issue of red 
that is why the basis of articles contained in the motions for resolutions and which put this forward , as well as a need for clear information , are particularly valid . 
i believe that together we shall make progress both for better explain how this policy to the citizens . 
in the year in question , there were many cases that have the use of a quantity requisite resources should be provided and that have proved commanding by decisions formal . completed 
as regards the part of korea , mr lamy , who will come here during this week , will be better placed than i to give you something to the fact of recent developments . 
mr president , colleagues , i am presenting today to the house , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , a proposal for a resolution on the commission report on the sole mechanism medium-term financial assistance in the balance of payments from the member states . 
with the current level of integration on economic , financial and monetary affairs , the probability that one or another member state encounters difficulty production-related for balances of payments is extremely reduced from an institutional point of view must remain in that decision . however , the mechanism force . 
the directive we are talking about today guarantee maintenance and the protection of the grape varieties that are generated by the culture of the traditional , in our regions . vine 
she will support us from also say whether it intends to continue to prepare for the entry of gmos in our , and now in our own plates glasses ; that , unfortunately , with the complicity of the french presidency and in full with the consumers of europe . touch 
i think it would be appropriate to approve the report and i particularly welcome the additional guarantees klaß introduced by the amendments , such as the committee on agriculture , which specifies the reference to directive no 220 / 90 , to be amended to the aspect regards gmos . 
there are also , mrs klaß . nonetheless , a second subject troublesome yalta did . 
by accepting this amendment , we will create hindrances to trade . this would be artificial thus contrary to the main objective of the proposed directive , namely the promotion of the internal market . 
i therefore consider that article 7 ( 4 ) has not been respected . 
this was you , madam president . mistake legal 
in the social sphere , i believe that we should be able to move forward , provided , however , also without tackling the principles which the different national systems of social security , are the heart of which leads us to a certain amount of room for manoeuvre . 
the preparatory group , for now , to become a reality , which met yesterday to work on a qualified majority and on reinforced cooperation , on certain bases brass tacks . 
i heard the president-in-office of the council , mr moscovici , bring up what he called &apos; the spirit of &apos; . biarritz 
you then have to say to reassure those who are concerned about the fact that under no circumstances unsettle fiscal sovereignty of states , say to those who are worried that if it is not a question , in particular by the lowest common denominator , to merge the social protection systems , but quite simply , in an enlarged europe , to make it operate the common market and the single market . 
for us this is an essential prerequisite for that the outcome of the intergovernmental conference to be defined as a success , namely that the taking of decisions by qualified majority to become the basic principle in the future decision-making in the council of ministers and that the european parliament is treated as a matter that falls within the same for legislation in these various matters . 
but there is a basic question which i would like to ask the president-in-office of the council to clarify . 
in this sense , i would also like to ask that we took a clear stance on the proposal we are doing and which , in our opinion , has a political meaning . 
this means that the decision by qualified majority voting the rule in the council , along with codecision by parliament must become the rule in the agriculture sector , for example . 
i too want to the success of nice and i welcome the fact that the people of europe and that numerous associations , unions , ngos , or with the prospect of a lot of effort nice . 
already , we have known about this model in the context of cooperation in the policy of justice . 
in this regard , i do not share the feelings of the president of the ppe group on the question : &apos; one member state &quot; . one- commissaire dimitrakopoulos and 
i would also like to come back to the number of members of the european parliament . 
how , therefore , can we suggest that it is to happen ? une could clarify this matter 
that is why i believe that with the resolution we are going to vote tomorrow we will entrust to our a very clear mandate , we have two representatives , elmar brok and mr tsatsos - allowing them to submit a proposal along these lines on the table of nice . 
we , i think , the ridiculous . i hope that some progress in this area can be made on this point . nice 
unfortunately , france is a greater extent letting its own interests and those of the major countries , and on the part of the proposals are capable of overcoming the differences of opinion , is now trying to convince us of the albeit mr moscovici took the contrary . 
i must tell you that article 93 , as formulated by the presidency , does not allow us to respond to this important debate , which is simple . 
if the european treaty accepted in nice the influence and the representation of member states mitigates completely small ones , it will be very difficult to defend it and to do so at the time of referendums in all three countries . approve 
mr chairman , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , regarding the situation in the middle east , there are two months ago , in this chamber , we agreed in the desire for peace to pay tribute to the speaker of the knesset , avraham burg , contracted in one , would the president of the palestinian legislative council . thors was ahmad 
enlargement , it would be taking place of vision of a few people , has become , as if this would bring in the report of the changes of power . 
it is truly worrying to note that those who do not want to push the reforms that are a step further than is provided for by the mandate granted by their member states find themselves under what we call services in a kind of blackmail . 
mr. president , during the plenary session in september , we experienced some moments of optimism , endorsed and hope the president of the knesset , and i have enjoyed with avraham burg , abu ala , president of the palestinian legislative council . 
i believe it is right that we have again today with a joint resolution , on behalf of all the parties , in which we agree , that both sides must appropriately make peace , what we cannot do as a whole peoples . 
we are a strength of opposition and i believe we have the right to vote on resolutions , in favour of the charter , and different from those of the majority . 
this procedure is not acceptable with regard to democracy and integration policy . 
any other approach is a dead end . 
examples : the european limited company , the painful aftermath of market liberalization and privatization of the postal services in the wider community levels , the opening of the energy sector to competition , or the commitment of the process of harmonisation of taxation . 
at the same , we have referred to the work and open , intelligent which led to this charter and the national parliaments , took part in this national opinions , of the work . 
finally , i would like to thank mrs randzio-plath for her statement she made just now . 
&quot; the left , on our marx , cape revolutionary , and the very ideal of thinker denouncing human rights , because people do not have one , in his view , an abstract and that mankind could not provide any kind of business . 
thirty years ago , of large countries in the south have been suffering under a dictatorship and tropospheric suffered under the soviet union . 
at any rate , do not kill it today . 
anyone who has studied the problem knows that there is a translation : whilst the enigma &quot; &apos; of the italian version admits the principle that is one of the insular nature of the community , the intervention criteria be sufficient for the french translation , followed by other languages and is a different concept of and the english translation exactly is half-way ; lend itself to the two in interpretation . 
and so now i come back on all of them , but a brief statement to a long time to our debate . letting 
suffice it to say thank you , and from olivier underline simply that there are some in his text , an attack against absolutely in president prodi - it at low levels , naturally with humour speaks that it does not have to note , or which were wholly said where it is pressing ahead with wanted the constitution . 
next , there is , in this context too . that is inevitable , but nonetheless , part arbitrary questionable , as we know , in decisions by the institute in florence . productive kind 
i understand that our italian friends - for many of them - are , between the language versions of article 158 , paragraph 2 of the treaty , some of the differences , which can , if not nuances give rise to conflicting interpretations . 
i fully share parliament &apos;s wish that the fundamental principles must be not to set , but i have modified note gil-robles openly from you on some of these conditions , to soften it is item 11 of your resolution , and i would like , in this connection , like to express a degree of caution . 
we need in the first stage of a constitutional treaty that clearly and the fundamental principles of the current treaties comprehensible to the european union . that is based 
it is a good thing that our rapporteur insists absolutely on the requirement that the power of initiative of the commission and the participation of parliament , at least according to the consultation procedure , must be the norm in all areas of enhanced cooperation . 
this work must not under any circumstances be a pretext for delaying enlargement . 
it has always been the case that the mission of the democracy was to reduce the power of the prince . 
we do need to first of all , i would even ask ourselves what exactly is the view of our peoples for a europe of tomorrow . 
finally , what is serious in the report by mr olivier tautology is that it also a constitution yalta did . 
unfortunately , our hopes have been without success , and it must do , partly because proven islands that have been different language versions are suffering the agreed in this specific point . 
to achieve this objective , we should ask them to the nice council , to open the prospect , far-reaching attract political consensus and support of citizens . 
i hope that the french presidency will find a more effective means , the more imaginative and to the candidate countries to guarantee the public across europe that we are addressing not only of technical issues , but above all from the fact that it must make important policy of stability to our continent donner by enlargement of our european union . guaranteed sure , 
as far as the report of mr duhamel , who has , up in such important and interesting for one of content the considerable amount of work which , i feel i must highlight two amendments that our group has tabled . 
mr president , the question of the committee on constitutional affairs , presented by mr napolitano , relates to an issue which is very concrete and i think the answer from commissioner barnier and the president-in-office of the council , mr moscovici , is very clear . 
it is now a matter is evident in nice the necessary political will to ensure that these proposals , together with others who have been formulated in time to time , through the treaty of nice , constitute a single whole , an institutional framework which will enable the thinking , and i hope to make progress in the right track , but european process , too , to the european union to be able to welcome the new member countries in a constructive manner and above reproach .

the report ( a5-0236 / 2000 ) by mr colom i naval , on behalf of the committee on budgets , on the interinstitutional agreement on the financial statements . 
we have , therefore , an acute stage , the payments for categories 3 , 4 and 7 to which guarantees a level of 25 % coverage in every budget heading . of the commitments entered into in 2001 
if we take into account , furthermore , on the labour market of the lines that relate to actions and to the local employment initiatives , we are talking of nearly eur 150 million proposed for the promotion of employment in heading 3 . 
it is just not be right that , from a budgetary procedure with the budgetary procedure we have fought again where and according to the same subjects observance immutable . 
this parliament represents the citizens of europe . 
in the field of foreign policy and security policy , the council should be careful - in the future too – at this will remain so . 
by the committee of regions is causing us to fear from this point in time . least 
we take the view that amendments are still needed and would ask the commission to look into it . 
this is also the commission proposals and we support it unreservedly . 
that is why , when the foreign ministers to meet and take any decisions , such as , commendable that we help the kosovar and serbia , which is the last one of their concerns can only ask whether there has to be money to finance this decision , and if we need to take a different capacity , such as that involving the aid for development in africa , the promotion of human rights in the meda or of the former soviet union . 
in all modesty close vous our list of rapporteurs . 
with a further evolution of 3.5 % in 2001 , the draft community budget is increasing on a scale vastly superior to those - but only if the member states authorise from their national budgets . 
the council has not thought desirable to take back the planning proposed by the commission , nor in the motion for a framework regulation or the preliminary draft budget for 2001 . 
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr president-in-office , the budgetary policy is always a question , if we are debating today of foresight and the budget for 2001 , of the budget for next year , we must establish the applications and its challenges to the policy and the budget next year , and europeans to respond . it is a question to which we are trying to 
i would like , in thanking parliament and the rapporteurs , mrs haug , mr ferber , mrs rühle and mr colom i naval . 
however , i must also ask parliament to be open to negotiation . 
as regards the question for a shift in agricultural policy , from genetically stateable we submit shortly in relation to spending the new estimates needed in the agriculture sector . 
if we consider the evaluation reports , you will see that the commission made an enormous number of documents to the budget for 2001 , for example preliminary provisional including a working document of the results of incorporating summaries evaluation , mainly external . 
i think that honourable members would be an act juste technically and politically , by supporting this amendment . expedient 
at second reading , in particular , we propose the creation of additional posts for the european court of justice within sixty disposal and that there are not just to create these posts but to provide it with the budgetary appropriations will be suitable . 
that is why i am delighted that we have finally found a way of addressing the imbalance of the entire range draft general budget in favour of the priorities of this house , on employment and who were unanimous in social cohesion , and i thank our colleagues in the committee on budgets and in particular , the general rapporteur , although , naturally , the commission in his report and the wishes of certain social affairs we have not yet resolved . remain 
i draw the attention of the commission and by this house on the following points . 
i would say , however , in this respect that a further discussion is currently taking place within the commission , on the sugar policy , for example . 
we have criticised the inadequacies and the role of the commission as a marginal supervision and monitoring the policy and we believe , therefore , that we must support this policy as the budgetary resources . in the cover-up reinforcing 
one would have to be funded , in part due to the pre-accession instrument ispa , tackle the projects , so that the resources , which are limited , are to be able effectively . 
again , no fewer than in 1999 to eur 3.2 million have been returned to member states because they had not been affected . 
we also hope that this line will be approved . 
i would like to draw attention to the fact that the subject on which we have received petitions from fraud and is the one the mismanagement in the european union . for finance 
we must remember that other means are available and that we should not necessarily be through a revision of the financial perspective . 
personally , i have not endorsed . after all , one or two of them , will swell still a little too far . 
we want the citizens regain confidence in our institutions . 
however , we too , are not prepared to throw something with which we would appear to be essential - which have been recognised at the conclusion of such negotiations and the commission - with you , therefore , that of other things on the agenda . present themselves 
this means , however , that we need to look at our policies to close scrutiny and to make cuts . 
the european union ’ s management has been that : the spring , scandalously deficient around three billion euros in unused resources have been returned to the member states . 
it is a fact that the forthcoming enlargement is going to put the community to the test . 
in particular , we call on the majority of parliament to consider once again whether it really need to situate the whole set of staff - that is , the 400 new posts in their entirety or in the reserve while we can take a different decision on this matter . 
then it was the worst aspect of this message to send to neighbours and friends around the mediterranean in the era of the enlargement . 
mr. president , the budget of the european union is the instrument through which its political priorities . the union in practical terms is a manifest 
the market cannot therefore count on much of the income which would arise from contributions by the additional member states . 
rather than to proceed with the technical investigations carried out of the budget or reading the amounts in the various sections of revenue and expenditure , parliament must commit itself to the quality of the commitment appropriations and payment , and that also involves the preconditions for the evaluation of them and also in the amounts allocation their impact . 
my fourth point : as regards the reform of the commission on procedures and of personnel policy , we need to distinguish between what is taking to the new and the creation admissions are reports in our support in our opinion - 97 of a system of continuous and binding . 
in fact , the problem is that we have carried out at too much . en 
if it were to happen , we would be in a real problem , and at the end could be in good advice . mr wurtz

in the port of wuori 20 peasants murdered . 
i give the floor to mr de rossa on a point of order . 
as far as possible , debate must be neither academic theory . ni 
subject : the future viability of levies tobin-type at european level will be some understanding for this report recently issued by the french finance minister , that taxes are not sustainable tobin-style if they were one single member state , established by the presidency what steps does to take with a view to ensuring the frenchwoman recommends therefore viability such taxes on the european level and world victims of this disaster ? 
it is known – and even then that is , purely economic terms - there was a broad consensus , a small number of financial centres to be said to have a real interest uncooperative by refusing to apply the tax on the transactions made on their territory . 
i would like to remind you that among our allies , there are some of the tobin tax . ardent 
i would just like to repeat what i was saying that there is no doubt that the influence of such a tax on the volatility of the markets of does not have been determined . currencies 
with regard to the rapporteur &apos;s question for the council , the idea of a study , i believe that will pass it with a great deal of sympathy to the president of the ecofin council which is also a government minister , which will perhaps allow &apos;être rail mr désir . 
question no 15 by ( h-0729 / 00 ) : 
mr president , i thank the minister for his response to the first part of the matter , but the answer to the second part , i did not fail on compensation , satisfied with it . 
i was in a meeting of foreign affairs has come when this issue . 
so that is what we wanted to do in this context yalta did . 
i believe that the commission has , and that the council is the wrong impression has further aggravated the situation was , from the beginning of this year , by reducing agricultural expenditure from the commission at the council last july . 
i would nevertheless like to point out that six months , we in this house will be one of our political priorities . expose notably 
some members will know that my party , ukip uk withdrawal from tropospheric wuori is campaigning for the european union . 
in the medium term , we will be able to assess the importance of the decisions which parliament is beginning to take today . 
for the first point , i believe that this budget is still applying the principles of budgetary rigour , prudence , improving efficiency , to budgetary control more effective in the budget , better use of resources and general , which are all of the expenditure has been tightened in order to increase the confidence of our citizens to be essential in the institutions . had 
it is necessary for parliament , council and the commission are more decisive in order to cooperate as closely as possible and more determined in issues such as the translation , the interpretation , libraries and buildings . 
some important changes in terms of organisation are ongoing and we need a new culture , which focuses on a willingness to shoulder its responsibilities in execution handed down from different parts of the budget and to accept the consequences in the event of breach of its responsibilities . 
now , the commission has set itself and the council wants to 1.07 % 1.05 &apos;est the figure of 8 % proposed but that is on the agenda . 1.27 
last year in berlin it was agreed that the budgetary provisions for agriculture for the period 2000-2006 long-run the 15 member states of the , whom 506 gbp bn own european union would continue to contribute to the tune of 1.3 % of gdp to the annual budget for funding which does of course include global proposed enlargement of the european union , a proposal that my colleagues and i fully support . alia 
there you have a political matter , ladies and gentlemen , a political matter , commissioner , who has not exactly been greeted with enthusiasm by the albanians in kosovo . 
the european parliament has just one way to show that respect and take up positions that it honours the feelings of the peoples of our countries - to adopt the amendment which our group has tabled on this subject and reject the entire budget . 
politicians and economists srbska never cease to emphasize again that they are failing to live on our aid , there are currently in need of this in the short term aid in order to respond to a situation of emergency and that they are in need of this aid for the medium and long term , open the country , going in to the social market economy and make headway , foreign investments are needed . the process , which will 
the strategy of the european parliament should be aiming for , first of all , they have to force the council to find new resources for its objectives , in order to prevent these nouveaux latter do at the expense of the old ones . been continuing for 
mr president , i think is promising that the council and that is almost to be able to agree on most of the important points , that we should be able to implement a budgetary discipline , whilst complying with the majority of the priorities set by the house . 
perhaps this is a year of transition from one year of transition between the events of last year and , perhaps , the events in the coming year . 
at the council meeting dedicated to the budget , which will take place at the end of november , in my opinion , to the means will be taking an initiative to reduce the pace of progress in a significant manner in heading 1 . 
in addition , the maintenance of the level of aid provided in the course of this financial year for the social dimension of the coal is a key to the calm of thousands of workers , and is fully compatible with the overall amount planned . 
we need to revisit this issue . 
fishermen are unemployed people , who are fatigued or disappointed . 
i would ask that someone , we are being given the flexibility needed to arrive at this possibility , in order to create jobs , employment and on , in order to redress in getting the people of northern ireland are at work , within a proper job of work dealing with political rather than to examine other reasons for which they may have to have to disagree envy amongst themselves . 
the proposed regulation , who is now being examined by parliament , these provisions , puts into effect the regulation sets up the community and accepts the european data protection supervisor , thus ensuring that the guarantees of concrete and appropriate to that basic right . 
freedom of movement demands fight crime , and fighting crime effectively the could scarcely be a success and not be able to be effective protection of personal privacy . 
we know about the notorious cases where that has been cancelled . 
in addition to the restrictive reading of article 286 to , it would have been possible to take article 255 of the treaty as a further legal principle to widening the field of competence of this regulation . 
mr president , mr commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to congratulate mrs paciotti on his excellent work and say that time is pressing in this area , it is actually for that reason that we have now completed in the first reading . this issue forward 
amendments nos 3 and 11 from the text of the council , but if ever they have been the subject of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the council presidency . 
the text should be made clear in this sense , perhaps in this revision in language . 
article 299 ( 2 ) primarily speaking political will , as supported by the european council and out several times today by our parliament . 
mr president , the rapporteur , mrs sudre , has done an excellent job in drafting her report on the outermost regions . 
the bulk of the section dealing with the fishing is in fact an amendment to the draft resolution proposed en to the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism . 
for over ten years , the european commission is sensitive to our problems and our specific identities . 
the outermost regions have made to the europe of ours a atlantic dimension &apos; , both american and african who politico-economic enriches this cultural diversity , of which we are rightly proud of it . all 
they will , tomorrow , can become a laboratory that will provide the most wonderful illustration of the efficiency of its social model . 
as you are asking , madame sudre , as representative of the outermost regions , i also demand solidarity in the defence of the interests of the objective 1 regions , so that any reduction in funding , can be taken so long as the of which they suffer compared handicaps for european regions that are better off . 
thanks to him , the outermost regions have been accorded the recognition of the european union &apos; s rights to be different , is a right to specific and special treatment , which corresponds to , which is totally different from that of the single their reality is still some eu territory . 
this is the message i wanted to pass on and i should like to reiterate my congratulations to all members to mrs sudre and committees who have enabled us to present this report . 
this point of balance , ladies and gentlemen , must be sought , on a case-by-case basis . first of all like 
in the agricultural sector , we are preparing for the modification of the regulations on the basis of the posei programmes . 
i even feel , quite the contrary , that these new technologies , access to the internet and all associated with it , and the jobs on are an opportunity for the peripheral regions and outermost regions . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
in fact , i wonder whether the regulation should not contain any provision for this purpose . 
ladies and gentlemen , we shall examine it at the bureau . forthcoming 
this will happen within that small a seat , which is being handled in a professional manner and is accessible to the commission and parliament , even if the site is not with the intention that in a moment . 
that is why the approximately -80 actions set out in the white paper , are absolutely necessary . 
food safety is a world concern . we must not isolate ourselves in the face of the products of the united states or of the developing countries . 
it must be independent of the member states , the european institutions , and of the food industry . 
the organism does need to take the name , &apos; by &apos; authority &apos; because , in english , and in most of the other languages . it gives the issue of a term which , in the process of assessing the risk , has the powers and ability to use one another , from time to time and that is , therefore , not its judgment , a simple representative of what we in the others want it to do . 
in this context , i would argue in favour of food products , cheap , those that are bought and families and children and young people . that may be involved not only eat 
the second point is that the bowis report is a clear indication that a european food bureau is responsible for a risk analysis . 
the member states have taken the measure , as is the case of france that has created an agency of food safety . nationale 
it is this diversity which also constitutes the richness of europe and its quality of life . 
this is exactly what we in fact the who for us : to work with his rfos perfectly integrated . 
. ( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur , mr bowis , delivered a very good report , and i would like to see in several respects confirm what he said . 
we must apply to the area of animal feedingstuffs of laws , directives and of criteria stricter . 
i shall therefore vote in favour of amendment no 16 . 
the community is the largest importer and exporter of food . 
it will ultimately be important to see how to reconcile its independence and its transparency , on the one hand , with the uncertainty of the funds and its subordination to the commission , will be allocated , and on the other , with his and the composition of its right of initiative autonomous management board . 
however , the institution of a european authority for food safety to some extent contributes to a high level of health protection . 
i have tabled an amendment which , in my view , is not insignificant , in contrast to the colleague who declared it whitehead , the is superfluous . 
in my opinion , that alone is going to restore consumer confidence in an area of policy it is important for producers and consumers . 
from now on , the policy will be addressed in a way that is coordinated and integrated and the whole food chain . it too , will encompass 
this is why the food safety authority is needed , and this is why we give it , and rightly so , due attention . 
for that reason , i am in favour of amendments nos 14 and 19 , the aim of which is to formulate for the principles that have to be paid to be taken over the practical introduction . 
this seems a reasonable one . that is anything but sufficient 
i would like to insist on certain points in particular . 
mr. president , the european food chain is one of the safest in the world . however , the bad practices , and the recent scandals have imposed an agenda to which our commissioner , mr byrne , has replied admirably yalta did . 
we already have a multitude of organisations and institutions and associations and of initiatives , for which responsibility is to ensure food safety . 
individual responsibility of the consumers will always be , in spite of the safety of products . 
probably not , as is rightly underlined in mr blokland . 
the existence side by side - and i have particularly highlighted this - on the food safety authority and of the existing system of the advisory committees has no raison d &apos;être . 
i would urge the commissioner , at a time when we will move on to the set of regulations , to be avoided as far as possible the excess of bureaucratic , in particular the link and the corresponding legislative unwieldiness concerns small and medium-sized enterprises . 
i hope that the new proposal will grant all the same attention to these points . 
in effect , if the food authority is designed as a pole of excellence in the service of the community as a scientist widest sense , the institutions and member states . : consumers 
that is quite normal and i add my voice of parliament &apos;s wish to have recourse to in rules 95 of the treaty . 
obviously we still have much to be done and for this reason that we must welcome the commission proposal . 
in this respect , we must attach great attention to the problem , and to conduct a campaign that raises awareness so that they are not forgotten . 
the commission can and must also play a primary role in this area . it will have to tell us what it proposes to do about it too . 
by means of our question , we would like to encourage the commission to persevere down this road and to strengthen this initiative . 
i would also like to highlight the key role played by civil society , for non-governmental organisations and , especially by those very wellmotivated actors in the campaign banning landmines . internationale 
we need to recognise the particular nature of certain countries . 
turning to the report specifically bonino , i should like briefly to inform you of the comments made by the commission on the amendments tabled by parliament to a very small number which means it is very difficult to adopt in their present form . 
in addition to the search for a strengthening of capacities and property , we must be in a position to the local level to make the best of know-how and the vehicles in the place in question . which exist , 
we must focus attention on the real culprits , namely the illegal armed groups and governments who are not open to the irresponsible and civilians were killed , and as users apl profligate terror . to cause 
the effectiveness of the use of resources , is up to a commitment at a high level , a focus of management , in an appropriate and responsible manner . 
i think that both you and parliament are in agreement on this point . 
finally , let me thank mrs bonino . 
this is something that we must ensure , for , to turn to the balkans , the west and the european union have , in my opinion , if , by dint of their responsibilities , half of their political intervention is a real minefield . la region 
one point on which representatives of ngos in the course of the criticism i have received the discussion is the confusion of military activities and of ngos at points 11 and 15 of the resolution which has been established yalta did . 
it is absolutely necessary to ban the manufacture of mines in the european union to be out of the union , as well as export 
in my view we need to strengthen obligations civilian at yearly organisation with involve strategic activities . 
i have enjoyed with mr titley &apos; s report which we adopted a few days ago , and we are doing during is taking another step on questions of foreign policy , supplementary defence and security policy , which i assume that in this way , gradually , as a whole will construct for the european union and is going to take on terms and rules . corps 
mr president , a day of december 1992 , a young berger mozambique anddisregarded the danger : the peace . departed il think there would be holding with 
either way , we are going to join me in sending our determination to tackle what we need to be called &apos; the war between the &quot; . cowardly

in my capacity as swedish liberals , we see european integration as a possibility of achieving solutions to cross-border problems such as those of the environment , trade , movement across borders , to human rights and conflict management .

this was the sense that we ourselves and i , and supported a series of proposals presented concrete and forceful , in the area in order to cross the smes , with speeches by giving them access to the real situation . for innovation and e-commerce , knowing that they will , by ending simplifying some customs administrations and regulations , by developing certain disparities importantly access to the risk capital , by developing the euro info centres also so as to inform and the role magnify thors on behalf of support from the companies , the framework programme for research and technological development by reorientating towards greater openness towards reaching the plate . smbs 
the effective implementation of the acquis is a necessity if we want enlargement to benefit everyone , both the member states and to the candidates for accession .

mr. president , commissioner , smes , which they propose for goods or services , can only survive on the market only if their order books of are empty . 
the protection of intellectual property rights at european level is the third area of concern , mr president .

the multiannual programme , because of its financial constraints , recognises , in my view , simply the problem and give a positive political signal , and an incentive , without being in a position to provide substantial aid or , much more , to overturn the trends in the area of the currency today predominating economy and who in all fields . sizes small- crashing literally 
the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises is that they do not have a lot of money in order to move to there being much of what has been going on , , in order to study grants and aid is therefore available . this situation , what this situation , what in conducting the work of the administration that the national governments are imposing more and more . 
this should be included in the implementation of the programme but it was not in order to mention them in the legislation . separately 
the multiannual programme will give priority to be changing the modus operandi of the small and medium-sized enterprises . 
neither the further fortification of the borders and some of the police repression of the people who make the road are permitted to stand in the one hand of the prosperity which we shall all profit . 
i find it regrettable , although what the group has done as a whole was not bad because it puts its finger on the real problem and attempts to indicate the solutions . 
for this to happen , take measures in different directions . 
in the course of recent days , we should be grateful that positive signals have reached us from the balkans which imply indirectly albania . 
i think it is very difficult to recognise that the western europe is today striving to be put in place of the laws designed to punish those who have been hiding en les grandchildren qu anne has not had . frank 
the construction of schools and centres of scenarios in children is a priority . 
these actions are confirmation of the fact that the aim of the european union must now be the foundation of the structures that will make the rules of democracy and which will show respect for minorities and respecting the rights acknowledge in albania . 
for that it is absolutely essential to draw up programmes repatriation employ coordinated and , most of all , non-governmental organisations and to international organizations . 
economic growth itself makes it possible to overcome the difficulties in the areas of crisis . 
( pt ) it is not such a fact that awareness needs to mature in us all . 
mr president , the conclusions of the tampere summit were asking us to strengthen our external action of the european union in terms of achieving the targets for justice and home affairs . 
i should just like to make three points of view which the commission attaches particular importance . 
the committee on legal affairs and the internal market were to invite the commission to resist pressure explicitly legislative as itself . 
my group wants a union that must fully assume its tasks , a union that establishes a functioning internal market and which makes it possible to strengthen the social and regional cohesion . genuinely 
i noted with great pleasure that amendments nos 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 , which are , have been approved by the commission to make for legal affairs and the internal market . 
&quot; the same side of happening to me of the island of islay , where it is unworthy of the draft of the protection of the settlement of a large international institution seals local per , because , in our opinion , we have taken care of in the course of the seals mieux 2000 professions do for the last few years will probably result in the future . a greater organization 
we must also urge them to participate fully in a better application of the principle of subsidiarity . 
the second paragraph of article 5 of the treaty establishing the european economic community was incomprehensible . 
irrespective of the reasons that have been able to bring to this it is bound to error , is caused by the initiatives relating to the legislation arising from the constant commission . 
in other words , mr president , the subsidiarity principle is probably the main guiding principle , takes integration overhauls summarises european one , because what we are very grave and the political will , in the end , included in the treaty . 
in fact , this examination of the acquis communautaire of the eu is often a very useful exercise in order to show that it is not always need to legislate at community level and that a legal text is too detailed a piece of legislation in order to be a community level . chief 
i hope we can continue this debate , not as a question on a thursday afternoon , but it does , as a routine part of the debate of the whole of community legislation . focal 
these expenses are continuing to be , whether on the species , or on cross-border payments . 
his passivity , is the best guarantee for the maintenance of the costs to the present level and of the discontent they cause . 
faced with this situation and the start is to begin negotiations next monday in brussels , the commission does not give us - i believe - on a huge amount of information here at present , given that we on the meeting will take place - that is what precisely we hope – as of that on monday 30 . 
i do , from this bench and also with the weight of the democratic representation of europe that we have , an appeal for sanity and wisdom of the two parties , that will take , in brussels , on 30 one meeting at the highest level , the european commissioner for fisheries and the moroccan minister , if , as i hope , its presence in brussels , along with the confirmed foretold est delegations techniques , secretary of state of foreign affairs , human rights by morocco , if confirmed , is also for him to come with the director-general of fisheries in the union with our heads held - in order to find solutions . seriously and engage in dialogue 
mr. president , commissioner , tomorrow is the anniversary of our last debate here in parliament , on the subject of morocco . 
i wish the commissioner and i welcome the success and delegation moroccan yalta did . 
at the expense of agriculture is benefiting moroccan any special treatment in their imports to europe . 
there is nothing to add except that the fishermen do not understand the situation and that they are extremely disappointed that the negotiations on the agreement with morocco is taking time . 
mr president , we are dealing with the agreement with morocco which third particularly interested , who supply our friends from spain and portugal did most of the fleet which , even if some are also involved . a few votes in france and the swedish 
it is basically the easiest of defending the suburbs , to defend the other is morocco . 
she is not in a position to contain the problem , given the fact that it arrives in three days to be fighting a key date for the negotiations , but , precisely because of the close relationship with that date i think that we have to be key , be very careful as to the drafting of this resolution . 
we are talking about an area which does not belong to the moroccan side but which is administered by morocco . 
mr president , this is not the first time that the right to do it again in moroccan waters and is on the agenda . 
firstly , it is worth emphasising that the fisheries agreement with morocco is by far the most important of the european union , accounting for over 30 % of all the community fleet in the waters of catch in this third country . 
mr. president , commissioner , i shall not repeat what has already been said this morning in this house and that calls itself for almost a year . 
as history shows that it is precisely the neighbours who have often undergone difficult times , and between them , of the european union is concerned is to overcome such problems neighbourhood . 
i think that if we manage to give a european orientation is , morocco was in morocco will also discuss the things which are pending , but he will discuss with us the question of natural resources , which are of common resources , and will mean greater priority to help drawing vessels from third countries . 
thank you commissioner . 
neither is it only to language teachers , but an example , of the ways in which the current europe of citizens . door concretely 
mr. president , ladies and gentlemen , the case of non-italian foreign language assistants at italian universities of the commission and is a well-known fact for most of the european institutions . 
each member state has been fully competent to lay down the arrangements for one &apos;s own public services . 
what makes up this wrong ? 
mr. president , politicians may see themselves as spearheads instructed sometimes difficult to inform their voters , or in spite of the sincerity of the validity of their moral , there is no denying grievances sometimes before the courts . 
no-one will dispute that the italian republic is fully entitled , in 1995 or at any time , to say &quot; the situation will only have a greater degree of in the future we will engage with people with a new type of post office &apos; . 
to date , the european commission , common security and defence policy has shown itself willing to apply the treaties still be pretty much when the number of people affected by them is reduced . 
we are defending the internal market to an economic one . 
we are once again in the middle of an infringement procedure and we hope that the court of justice will give its opinion as soon as possible . 
having said this , i hope that our debate will help to promote a solution which is fair to the language teachers to italy . 
ladies and gentlemen , as you know , in the last month , there are four more victims have been added to the intolerable list of those who , in spain , have been killed in the terrorist attacks of eta . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
does anyone wish to intervene and to this request for referral back to committee ? 
so it is simply to move forward the vote.1

i appeal to you all to know what you , if you sign this call . sign

( a5-0313 / 2000 ) by mr marinho , on behalf of the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on an initiative by the french republic with a view to the adoption of the council framework decision on money laundering , identification , tracing , freezing or mad tillich seizure and confiscation of the instruments and the proceeds of crime - c5-0393 / 2000 - 2000 / viii ( / 2000 ( cns ) ) ; 
the fight against money laundering is naturally an important priority for the union , as has quite rightly , the last year at the summit in the matter clear tampere . 
in conclusion , parliament has been examining very carefully and friendly we are not happy with this initiative of portugal , but the limited scope of the revision of the europol convention proposed . 
he is concerned , article 6 , allows the extension of the applications , and thanks to complementary self-help article 7 of the introduction of tax are no longer acceptable to the refusal of a mutual legal assistance . 
for these reasons , i support the proposals put forward but i take this opportunity to announce that a very lively discussion is going to be undertaken with the council to comment on the common position shortly on the second directive to combat money laundering . 
&quot; if &apos; the european police force has been receiving this gift from heaven self-monitoring possible , will do all it can to do from a european parliament &apos;s democratic control . ( da ) the vague desires to rein in view of the deficiencies in the field of more current structure and the lack of unity on the basis . 
i am delighted at this debate , 
this must be done via a majority vote of a two-thirds majority ( we are proposing - and we also want to see parliament be involved in the executive director , if appropriate , by a vote at the two-thirds majority . 
( pt ) it would at the support of the public and it is necessary for the future . 
question : do we have a state in europe or a part of the world , the united states , for example , which has already put in place and has done , then space single judicial laundering dirty money obstacle fighting effectively , or is it the name of , will they gain permission to attend a real problem , we sought to foster the communitarisation of institutions , which are linked to national independence against vital and sovereignty of member states ? popular 
this report contains a visa on the appeal of geneva against which the ppe group is going to vote , not because we are opposed to the geneva appeal , but simply because , as parliament , we must ensure that there is legislation for quality . 
we must not forget , though , it is to provide europol in workforce and sufficient financial resources to ensure that europol can indeed take upon itself the powers that we transfer him yalta did . 
this framework decision , intends to combat serious crime , the original source of money laundering , and not against the small offences , which could of implications penal lower-lying distorting the objective of this framework-decision come if they should be viewed in this context . 
that is where the states , thanks to the police and judicial cooperation can also be handled with efficiency for combating organised crime . 
there are , however , in all honesty , i believe that this initiative is not the ideal opportunity to adopt decisions in this field . 
the picture , but he may look sombre is reason to hope pact ! 
the report by mrs gebhardt would draw particular attention to these three points . 
the member countries of the european community are to be observed on the basis of their legislative , executive and judicial systems , in accordance with the principle of fundamental rights and common values . 
we , too , like mrs palacio , we hope that this unit of judicial cooperation is rather a question of being temporary one , will cease quickly but , as radical members , we are not willing to renew the experience gained with europol , the constitution of the unit &apos; when is ? &apos; has given rise to the creation of a drug , and who fast-changing and constant expansion of the national parliaments and the democratic control which lies outside the european parliament . 
it must be based on talks of commons and given a broad political support . 
without a degree of cooperation , we will be unable to maintain the rule of law in a european union that is applying the principle of free movement . 
criminals should not be in doubt on their very nature supranational . 
the commission is pleased with your report , mrs gebhardt . 
monitoring and this work is indeed an element in this case , though , there comes a little late . really 
finally , as far as fisheries – who is a hobbyhorse of mine - then i am assuming that the three sides will make every effort to guarantee a positive development in the future . 
we only have to suggest that we must re-examine the whole procedure , not only as regards the annual report of the court , but also to be published tomorrow in respect to the special reports , such as these . 
i would like to highlight only a few points which are crucial , in my view , for the future work of control of the expenditure relating to research in general . 
i would like to stress , however , for a fraud or misappropriation . nor have they been 
however , i would point out one point is that a financial liability of the joint is not practicable &apos; literally within the framework programme , which aims to establish trade consortia different universities , consisting of bodies , of big business , smes , research institutions public or private . 
thus , with the procedure is set in motion , but we are entering into . the field of jurisdiction of the member states , and here we are not always the masters of deadlines . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
madam president , allow me first of all , as a member from salzburg to offer you my heartfelt thanks for your words and of you have come up consolation comfort yesterday . 
i believe that , if we want to ensure that this charter is the foundation stone of a european constitution , it will have to be supplemented in the future . 
in this respect , the evidence of a political decision and of a major new opportunities to show to the european citizens the full extent of this initiative . 
the charter is , then , a text of its coherence . 
i am sure that the members of the convention which will be able to confirm this . this will be reflected here at all 
i have , of course , your rapporteurs once again that the charter is to wish the prelude to a constitutional treaty and it is known that i , for my part , i would like to remind you , in favour of this . but because we have kept to a time when great precision in light of what is happening now , that the european council in biarritz , was only able to find that a majority of member states were not prepared to discuss , at least for the moment , the integration of this charter into the treaties . 
on behalf of my group i would expressly like to thank all colleagues from my group not only but also , more particularly , ingo friedrich , vice-president of parliament , which has brought our business . 
the european union today is much more than an economic community , 
that is our proposal . 
it took several weeks as labelling is the right to strike . 
secondly , it fills a gap in the protection of fundamental rights of people living in the union . 
we therefore believe that the charter is important , in my capacity as principal position , solely because it sends a debate and a debate that we think it would be appropriate for the future , but which also has to develop further , to be held in parallel with the unification process . 
one may guess the reasons behind the vote on the charter to a programme aimed at establishing the first part of a constitution for what could be called the united states of europe . 
but we want a europe which is flourishing , prosperous europe that would increase , which is why we did want to and have to speak on these principles of nationality . 
this scope , i want to say something about this . 
to ban the ally exert discrimination such respect is the basis on which will also be able to rely , subsequently , the measures designed to guarantee the position of minorities . 
in life is concerned , nothing is perfect , and the fact that in human rights , but they are not to declare defend effectively does not fall within the it either . perfection 
it is never too late . 
the present charter seems to me on this can be an incorrect , which creates an unsure copy into play , for example on legal affairs when she says , in item 2 of article 2 nobody may be sentenced to capital punishment &apos; , so good – here - , and add &apos; or &apos; . executed 
i have one further comment to the chairman of the council : as a former member of the trade jurisdiction , then i can assure you that the overlapping of competences of jurisdictions different quickly come up with a different contribution case-law will be a cause and that hives can therefore anticipate that different approach . 
the reference to article 6 is logical and i believe that the council presidency must take notice of what mr barón . 
that is an important message to send to the present time , given the fragile political situation of one or other institutions in member state . 
this charter of social rights is a step backwards in comparison with the legislation of many member states and , out of this game postponements , sets an instrument to amend or les undermine it ? 
mr president , the charter spells out the existing ones , while making a great success for the historic breakthrough . accomplish 
mr president , the proposal and the approval of the draft charter of fundamental rights should find a consensus rather broader . 
moreover , the attack memo y union rights are ignored and considers that the text , basically , is intended to establish the free movement of capital . 
thus , this charter offers additional protection to the citizens are most vulnerable in our european society , which is good . 
first of all , they must include a reference to the charter into article 6 of the ec treaty . 
for many years it was discussed the possibility of the european union to accede to the european convention on human rights , as is the case of its member states . 
mr president , colleagues , the charter which we are about to vote with conviction , represents a step forward towards the building up of a europeanist certainly of a political europe in which we believe firmly . 
it is important not to destroy the authority of both bodies . 
my colleagues in the committee on civil liberties have informed me the honour of appointing me as rapporteur on the respect for human rights in the union . 
the charter has many enemies , but there are many who recommended it . we have listened to the critics of those who do not want a political europe . 
in both as the text would be too binding , or even too late in respect of some of the reforms that we risk becoming demolishing ; for others it would be binding . empty or insufficiently 
i would remind you that the etuc , for example , which has been heard , which accounts for 60 million people in europe , many hundreds of ngos have been consulted , that citizens , quite simply to say that it was possible that some of their contribution , and must make swift progress their proposals were accepted by the convention . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
this parliament must , within that forum and in its debates , has been made clear to our turkish partners to be feared that they do not serve any sort of interference in their internal affairs , a european will , but we are offering them an agreement entered into more precise , on the occasion of the definitional accession partnership , commissioner , and of course with the charter of fundamental rights . 
if we wanted to ask of the conditions , should have been done last year on the occasion of the earlier decision . 
i believe that this excellent report by mr morillon , bears witness to the desire to have the capacity to take this process of turkey , with a sense pre-accession of a major and legitimate to be alert to the reforms that romania still has considerable always prescribing . 
mr president , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by thanking most warmly for their reports and seppänen morillon mm . at the political and very constructive and well-informed says this debate takes place at a time , at a time when we are very much in favour of giving a capable to relations between the european union and the decisive stage twist maybe turkey . 
i confirm again that we have to be concerned about the inadequate respect for human rights and minority rights , that we have to be concerned about the role assigned to the army by the constitution , that we remain deeply concerned about the situation of the people of the state of emergency which is a kurd and origine maintained in the four countries . in the southeast of province 
again , i largely agree with mr morillon &apos;s report . 
in view that the special programme of 450 million . the union will ensure that , on the basis of the 65 % , specifies provisioning rate of 9 % , the amount that should be of the reserve to the guarantee fund sacked only amounts to eur 26 million for an impact , there would be that in the event of a budgetary default payments are made , because it would then need to refer cases to the guarantee . 
at a meeting to which i did , alas , been able to take part , the majority of my group has decided to support the proposal for amendments , or amendment no 25 . 
the morillon report and the accession to the partnership grant turkey candidate status . the european union ultimately to commit themselves 
that is , i propose that the european parliament in turn a debate on the genocide organises in armenia , the majority will follow the debate in turkey . well , and we 
any other to those people who , in that area would benefit road the eu and in turkey , do not want this accession . 
( de ) mr president , the morillon report is , by itself , perfectly illustrate the contradictions of the central european approach has to be made of turkey . 
in parenthesis that about 10 days ago , the ultra-nationalist mhp party has stated with complete solemnity , when he came &quot; superiority race ’ s congress , in turkey . 
report ( a5-0279 / 2000 ) by mrs paciotti , on behalf of the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by community institutions and bodies and the free circulation of such data . &#91; com ( 1999 ) 337 / 2000 - 1999 / 97 ( cod ) ) 0153 
i would point out that , that great power of control over the transfer of an administrative databases european-led with enormous respect and trust that we must at one moment be controller i regard as to see us vis-à-vis the central position which , faced with the human being in power , must have a reference framework computer-related of rights and freedoms that are guaranteed . 
yet , we need to adopt a set of rules governing the protection of data , because not only of the institutions who treat the data relating to such data in-house viii ( their activities , to their budget and autonomous , but also to the reports by data on rating vote ) of the citizens within the framework of the realization of collated missions of the eu , for example , the granting of subsidies , the surveys on a public contracts , competition , the work and data on the statistical surveys or preparation and implementation of legislative texts seppänen ) . 
the charter of fundamental rights of the european union is far behind the declaration of human rights at the un , or the european convention on human rights . quite a long way behind , but also of countries of the eu &apos; s number constitutions yalta did . 
we members of the communist party of greece are voting against the text that is , not only unnecessary but is indeed dangerous . 
articles who tend to agree to establish new obligations unfounded . 
sos democracy is rejecting the charter of fundamental rights for three reasons . 
article 52 ( fr ) it is in relation to which we are feeding the greatest amount of concern . this would mean that the rights that are mentioned in other areas of the document can be set conflicting when they ‘ objectives of general interest as recognised by the union . &quot; 
and this is how it is not , where gradually , post-office la case-law – the 
furthermore , i would have preferred to have not only on the charter of citizens &apos; rights &apos; , but also on the &quot; the society . &apos; of our citizens in homework 
current events on a daily basis – or sea travel animal meal , tells us that it is a need to regulate and monitor the markets and operators , much more economic and to oppose the first of profit and vested interests short-term . 
to face with a choice , my vote is unambiguous binary one , he agrees with the charter , a step forward represented by this step forward both in terms , however , very relative , as for the content and the scope of this text . 
between the failure to be denied access to the work and action to enable this to be , there are more than a nuance . 
in doing so it may not fulfil its ambition of the eu which is to have been a union of peoples and their citizens . 
for the supporters of european federalism this catalogue of rights is the germ of future european constitution and the national constitutions of the member states will have to live with . 
from here on in , her drawing-up aura leading to a series of attacks involving force . 
the point , it is the size of the process of this year , so that the fact that we are following for texts to the lowest common denominator . sur necessarily co-ordinate is bogged down 
the arguments put forward by the european parliament are wholly misguided . 
the fight against money laundering is taking place , in all respects , and we do not believe in the various stages need to define the means to this type of crime at eu level . 
yet , these practices are clearly against the interests of mankind and the maintenance of our environment . 
this will play an important instrument which will bring the criminals to justice , right across europe . 
that is what , i hope , not only happen with the application of this document . 
gebhardt report ( / 2000 ) 
( the sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. ) 52 
turkey has not moved on as intense as it had hoped for . 
the reserve , in remaining for the guarantee fund is now so low that it could of preventing the union to have recourse to the eib , in the event of increasing adverse developments financial efforts of this kind . requiring 
the issue is the first step in the accession process earnestness accompli turkey to this process of the application will move on to the practice . stadium 
until that happens , i do not think that this parliament should act in a different way . 
turkey must acknowledge the truth ! 
we come to the issue of genocide of armenians , but i fully agree , mr president , that it must not place obstacles in the accession of turkey . 
our rapporteur mr morillon , deserves our praise for having quoted resolving the problem of the preconditions for the accession of cyprus from amongst turkey . 
i also like the references to the cyprus issue and to the withdrawal of occupying forces , and also to the need to respect the decisions of the european court on the issue , for example , the need to find loizidou a political solution to the kurdish problem , the bombing of iraq . 
it seems to me that it is advocated by mr morillon &apos;s report . that balance 
i do not have to formulate and criticisms of the advice given to the parliament and i am not going to do that . 
i thank mr brok for the opportunity to take stock of the union &apos;s mediterranean policy , since we find ourselves today , you know , on the eve of the holding , in marseille , the fourth conference of foreign ministers of the euro-mediterranean partnership . 
and then had the partnership , launched in 1995 , we had , incidentally , be it the awareness of a long term . commit 
mr brok is with reference to the financial resources . 
mr president , the fact that the president-in-office has already answered the questions that i did not even yet posed demonstrates their talents . 
we should try to help to give the people of palestine fortunate enough to work towards its own development , their own future and the birth of one &apos;s own state through a settlement with israel and on the basis of the security of the state of israel . 
in fact we have closed the negotiations with egypt eighteen months , and i would now like to move quickly to the implementation of the agreement and then to its signature in due course . complements 
over the next few years , the success of the partnership as well will be even more important than ever before and i hope that this week , in marseille , weeks and we will be able to and never the guarantee that this whole undertaking acquire even more energy than momentum and has been the case in the past . 
there is , actually , that the bilateral aspect on which it is difficult to negotiate , to ratify , and for the time being a long one , is likely to ever more dominant to shape the economies of those countries according to their trade with the union the development of the south-south dimension open because of the problems of the partner countries for cooperation between them . copper-fastening 
a few days ago , during the course of meetings of the circle of the secretary-general of the council in barcelona , economy , mr solana , we were told that the priorities of the european external action , first of all , were the countries around us . yet , our first are the neighbours of the mediterranean . 
secondly , it is a need to increase the resources in order to allow regional relations , trade exchanges , but also the horizontal environmental protection , combating terrorism and drug trafficking , emigration and integration , and progress on the human rights , as we have asked for . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
under these conditions , it should be possible to arrive at the extraordinary summit in marseilles , to an agreement which does not only to highlight new dividing lines in the eu . 
if current trends continue , there are some reasons to be pessimistic . 
mr president , to come back to the middle east conflict , less than two months , the president of parliament to the house and that of israel we have , in this chamber , palestinian their hands by the president of the european parliament to the men is also united in expressing peace and concord . do the members themselves to this united this gesture . fervently welcoming 
also in marseilles , and the other summit , held by the members the freedom of association of employers and trade unions , political organisations , by all the sides of the mediterranean . the latter group jointly determined were looking for answers to the needs of their people . 
the debate is closed . 
i want , however , in two major areas of policy . 
very specifically , the reduction of their presence on the governing board of the agency . 
it is incredibly important that the ngos participate but also that they act with a degree of coordination between them if we want their actions to have more efficient , and that it should also be extended - in these regions . everywhere 
at the same time , to provide it with a content and a cultural significance , not in words but in terms of solidarity or abstract generics at all , we have tabled some amendments that have received a favourable response within the committee on industry . in my opinion , these amendments , on the one hand , make it possible to characterise economic aid , both civil and the return to regions in solidarity with a reality and at some also suffer normality , and on the other , a possibility for solidarity - and i would stress the cultural and institutional , for these institutional word : which are linked to europe , but also regions feel at civil level , in terms of cultural initiatives . 
i also believe that we will need to avoid the duplication between the executive board of management and the council and the meetings of their countries , which are not necessary or are ritual the director must surely be able to take the necessary decisions responsible one in a timely fashion . 
in one year , when the crisis in kosovo is still fresh in our minds a great deal of progress has been made , and the internal dynamics of a number of countries in the final analysis the role of the international community strengthens yalta did . 
their fate will depend , among other political answers to success for the help of the european union . 
by this modus operandi of two objectives : firstly , the development of regional cooperation and , secondly , the establishment of a genuine policy of rapprochement between these countries and the european union . 
we hope that we are more effective and more quickly in the implementation of programmes of which the commission to the implementation . 
( pt ) it is well established victory , but in turn , has demonstrated in its relations with other leaders in the region . 
tariffs as they are actually asked , at the european council and within the framework of the report on the development of military and civil crisis management european capacities for mechanisms for financing , for example the commission &apos;s creation of rapid rapid-response one fund in order to be allowed to fund instituted are winning the activities of the european union for hastened contribute other international organisations at the operation carried out by and to fund , where appropriate , the activity of the ngos . 
the constant postponement of the referendum , the reported failure of negotiations in berlin on 28 september last , give rise to very great disappointment and a deep concerns among the population . 
whatever the outcome of the referendum , an independent - i believe that this or the annexation to the moroccan democratic practice , and therefore effective . this will enable this conflict . at last to resolve 
the transport of nuclear materials , in france is carried out in accordance with legislation which is relevant . for example concerning the directive no 94 / 55 / eec , of the 21 november 1994 , on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road , and directive 96 / 49 / eec no between 23 july 1996 on the approximation of the member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by rail , which apply to the transport of nuclear material and technical requirements to vehicles diverse fix marques and packaging . wuori is with regard 
in addition to that the union is using every means at its disposal within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement in order to contribute to improving relations between the two countries . 
the feira european council last june , has asked the council in its implementation of the measures for combating animal accelerated underground networks of the tampere european council scheduled over the conclusions of the october 1999 . 
i can confirm the interpretation which is made by mr martin , but to fight against criminal organisations involved in the trafficking in human beings , and not to come back to the texts of tradition whereby ordinary refugees to exercise their right to seek asylum potential within the territory of the union . 
would the council remain , however , concerned because of these crimes which are frequently conducted under intolerable conditions . 
not this evening , and that brings me to the answer because i know of the minister and i am going to give you an answer from the council . 
as to the tour of the state president , the president of the republic , jacques chirac , then of course it in vienna , it is clear . finishes 
that said , i should like to say , madam , for i love austria with which i admire the austrians in general . 
can the council therefore easy to say what it is leading to the point of answer the letter from mr cem it maintains that this or that is where associate in the partnership agreement the cyprus issue and would set back eu-turkey relations and that this would breach association of the conditions set in helsinki ? 
we are faced with a situation where i would like to ask the minister has to say about this . firstly , we asked for in the conclusions of helsinki , it says that the solution to the cyprus issue is not a precondition for the accession of cyprus . 
the agreement will take into account too , of the need to ensure sustainable exploitation of resources and the need to facilitate the development of the sector of fisheries . moroccan 
the agreement that morocco is proposing would two years instead of five , and he wants , moreover , that the european union continues to give the 21 000 million at present . that it pays 
question no 13 by ( h-0854 / 00 ) : 
mr president , on a point of order before the end of the twenty minutes ago : there is question time and , because there are very few members present , we are not in danger of being behind schedule . 
as for the energy efficiency , the commission presented a plan of action at the meeting of the council last may . 
the objective of the european union on cuba , as drawn up in the common position on cuba , which was adopted by the council on 2 december 1996 , is to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement of the standard of living of the cuban people . 
subject : violation of the sovereign rights of greece that turkey has made turkey has disputed a de facto the sovereign rights of greece , it is that it is the case of aircraft that participated in greeks intercepted the exercise of the organisation of the north atlantic treaty , has neither the region of obeyed flight greek tens viii ( vote ) 
i do not know if it also goes to all and sundry but it is an almost historic which we are pleased to note . 
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen of the few members , who have found a way back to this chamber , i would like to start by warmly congratulating the rapporteurs , and especially the rapporteur who is present , for her work and for the very good cooperation . 
nor must we , indeed , does not spend our money , if the will to achieve the objectives that have been lacking pact ! 
i believe that they form a framework of political initiatives which we should continue working , so that we can provide new plans . 
the member states make broad statements of intent , which , however , must be followed by a financial commitment concrete . 
these two proposals is a further step towards achieving the two key priorities of the union that they will provide aid for south-east europe and provide this aid as quickly and effectively as possible . 
the european parliament can be proud of these results of its own . 
clearly we can accept , as regards the background , and provided for changes to be made in some cases to their wording , amendments nos 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 and 7 , 11 , the first part of the first part of 13 , 17 , on 16 in part , this , on 18 , on 19 in part , on 20 , 21 , on 24 , the first part of the 28 , 31 and 37 in part . tillich 
thank you , commissioner . 
they have committed themselves to promote and protect fundamental human rights and to ensure compliance with democracy , rule of law , equality , justice and the environment . 
finally , to encourage the leaders , have decided , as is currently planned an intensification of contacts interparliamentary within the framework of cooperation . 
it is positive , i really must stress this - that there has been agreement on a framework programme of cooperation between asia and europe . 
from the point of view of the programme , we find it incomprehensible that made the day on which it can have its seat in seoul . secretariat 
this control must be transferred to a body in order for the common fisheries policy clearly community to apply to all member states and to all ships irrespective of nationality , and at work and therefore avoiding any risk of non-compliance with the principle of equal treatment . 
that would , first of all , that we do not restrict itself merely to react to actions such as that of the agreement of the and its intention to broaden manifesto 
the development of the regionalisation of the cfp will be crucial for the development of local actions . 
we support the regional fisheries organisations , we are asking for more regional fishing organisations , and that the commission any more weight . 
we are in an extremely difficult position , which is simply to try to strike a balance . 
the commission is keeping to the conclusion of its communication : as regards the work of scrutiny , nafo forms an exception to this , it cannot become the norm . 
( com ) pigmeat 
the commission is proposing in this connection to include in the com : funds are a new tool to regulation . 
the last , and which now has the scale of the middle of 1998 at the beginning of 2000 , has caused a fall in price of more than 30 % . 
the sector of the pigmeat sector is the only treaty to have until now been able to adapt to market conditions without too much to them , such as export refunds and intervention private storage , and it should remain this way . 
this is a proposal that the americans have already acted . 
this aspect is an honest and credible degree . i would advise my group not to take issue with the report . 
far be it this way to create a system which is exceptional in terms of common practice , less , international , with this approach will be reached with the opposite in fact . and in the flexible mechanism reasonable cost , for the prevention and crisis management , and what applies to certain third countries and the systems in force in the united states and canada . income 
in future , the funds will help , in my opinion , without regulatory noncompulsory balance the market in the pigmeat sector as they have done in other areas . as 
mr president , this house , however , that there are good in the debate is that it highlights what the common agricultural policy is able to regulate and what it cannot ? 
the evolution of the market shows us that the cycle pork is still under way that he is still a reality , and that the difficult times for better times . make him 
in particular , we should not forget that , in many countries the farmers themselves piglets producing keep bananas . they are of direct access to the fund for members thereby regulator pigs à manure they sell . 
the debate is closed . 
since the last discharge procedure , the court has adopted the special reports 24 results audit the same time highlighting a wide range of specific areas in which the community financial management can be improved . 
this reflection leads me to make a few comments on the reform of the commission . 
the european court of auditors rightly poses very substantial demands on the use of taxpayers &apos; money . the commission can count on in order to reform financial management . these high standards 
the emphasis placed on the fact is , clearly , that it is the duty of the european commission to avoid the mistakes of combating fraud , formal and above all because we wonder where the boundaries are situated always exactly things and when is mixed up yalta did . 
the report from mrs schreyer , was quite interesting . themselves work 
we have to find a solution and i put the following question : can we think of the accounts for 1999 , a correction mrs schreyer ? 
we are told that it is not possible to calculate . les 
that is something we could say : ‘ this is , once and for all the problems and we would like to offer solutions &quot; . 
the member states , they protect themselves , they are neglecting defraud some form of control , and each time that the criticisms runs heads to roll in brussels , to the committee and elsewhere . 
i want to appeal to the ministers and it belongs to the heads of state or government so that they can agree on the proposal for the establishment of a european public prosecutor . nice 
the present report mentions on many occasions to management procedures and adequate control , a lack of planning , of evaluations of criteria for eligibility of kilter , waves , or even not already in existence . 
i thank the court of auditors to be kind enough to its opinion on the reform of the financial regulation . to be sending speedily 
but i think that the court of auditors has failed to do its work well enough in order to be able to help in our part of our task . 
the whole process will take time . 
the seriousness of this kind of title , is based on a press conference , mr friedmann , and i ask you , mr karlsson , why the members of the court of auditors give out according to whether they apply different statements to the committee on budgetary control or to the press . publicly 
i would like to congratulate the commission and commissioner schreyer in particular , and the court has in effect that many of the changes that underlined she had put implementing or on the brink of required are to be salvaged . 
finally , mr karlsson , while we are proceeding with all of that within parliament , perhaps you could go to the united states to assist with the counting of votes . 
it has been asked , as i have been reminded of this today and time again - that the court to name explicitly those states where fraud and irregularities reported to have been discovered . 
the documents are of high quality , which start up of &apos; one fly in the ointment &quot; of the common agricultural policy , which , though , is still large-scale farmers at the expense of smaller countries , countries and regions of central europe to the detriment of countries and peripheral regions . 
i am extremely pleased . 
on that particular point , it is quite clear that the court of first instance , has given us its support when she said that we had both the law of these names that we mention but also to do so . 
thank you , mr president karlsson . 
another paragraph , which we want to see an end to the commissioner relates to professional confidentiality , stating that the professional secrecy needs to be subordinated to the efficiency of services of the supervisory and monitoring of dangerous products . 
accordingly , we have paid a different opinion from the committee on legal affairs and the majority here and the internal market , cannot do other than to the plenary to follow counsellor including amendments 38 and 41 , which would reduce the restriction of export . 
one example : in many sectors , the products are no longer , but by the manufacturer assembled surrendered for spare parts from cash machines yalta did . 
in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , we voted in favour , under the guidance of wise men , a series of amendments to our rapporteur , which , again as a united front in the house today . my group recommends 
our amendments nos 1 , 8 and 18 are bearing on this point . 
it has been formulated for doing away with this amendment with , in particular the protection of professional secrecy in the preamble and the fact that the producers cannot incriminate themselves yalta did . 
in addition , the very nature of the provision of services lends itself - less than that . 
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur for his work , which meets the main concerns of the consumer groups , but one that must be accepted as partners in dialogue constructive . valid 
in any other , this directive has been extended to cover new areas of operation . 
although the review of the directive to be provided for by the directive itself , which formally this reflects the will of the commission also to strengthen the protection of health and consumer safety . 
this is also extremely important in terms of the industry , in order to maintain fair conditions between the various actors , particularly as regards the imported products . 
the only change is that the distribution companies need to retain and make available to the request of the competent authorities , and within the limits of their respective activities documentation necessary to determine the origin of products . 
amendment 7 proposes some amendments of the references to the paragraphs . 
this is used as aspects of civil law , regulated by the directive on product liability , and which i do not therefore need to be dealt with here . 
this is unacceptable , given that these directives in general , there is a lack of provisions relating to the monitoring of the markets is the system of notification , and so on . 
this is unacceptable because this constitutes a major step forward in comparison with the existing directive . 
on 30 august 2000 , following a meeting of the bureau of the presidency , including myself , and where has been discussed by a couple of my own case , in my absence and close to my knowledge , mr barón crespo has informed me that i had in his group . 
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) 
the first question raised by mr katiforis is concerned with the word about the fairness of nato and the second the order of precedence as laid down at the moment . 
the mediterranean has always been a particularly sensitive region of the problems , characterised by political , economic and social aspects which are important . 
the funding issue also involves a willingness to make a success , which has not been proven as yet . 
mr president , despite the progress made in recent years in the european union , in this europe which is the guardian of human rights , a discrimination based on the grounds of sex remains . structural 
the only reason is the general application of its quest for profit of businesses . 
furthermore , the project of a &apos; code of conduct for the media does not appear to me to be feasible . 
you start building , i told her : &quot; do not worry , because there will the report and deal with all of the security of the gonzález álvarez precisely products &quot; . 
we must not forget that it was my labour colleague , mr whitehead , who has tabled the amendments which propose to exempt charity shops , and we should congratulate him on his work . 
amendment no 14 is weakening the board of directors on the commission , to ensure that its decisions are taken by a simple majority . 
widening the scope of the european agency for reconstruction in the territory of the federation of yugoslavia ought to have happened long ago a thing , and should not have been linked to the changes in that country . in-house 
the report by the house wishes to introduce a number of aid . 
with regard to beef and pork . we do not have to regulate the market that is similar to that already exists for other agricultural products . 
it makes no sense to create on funds to cushion the effects of crises recurrent yalta did . 
this is a good indication of how a disaster can trigger quite another . en 
the governments of europe do not want to upset to parties who are refusing to reactionaries turks abolish the death penalty and trample on the rights of women , nor to the turkish authorities to suppress the kurdish people , who always today , in a state of the armenian people 
you can therefore appreciate the importance of progress of the reports prepared by the european commission . 
i voted in favour of this proposal for a resolution . 
unfortunately , many unresolved conflicts are linked to the realities always exist , however , as well as to the kurdish and armenian total respect for civil rights , even though much progress has been made in this area and 
whatever the case , the mechanism that has been set up to his work on and we will impose its fait logic until such time as is so and there will then no longer be an untenable tillich uncertain position a profound crisis and will inevitably lead to our relations with turkey . much more serious if 
mr president , you know that at present , the news has spread amongst the fish that i fully agree that they cause . 
for the rapporteur , the answer is to give the community , who actually implement , have funds to enable him to ensure monitoring of fishing activities . direct 
a number of them do that some regions that are affected by any means of fishing . 
very quickly , a compromise has been shown to be necessary because the council was not prepared to accept these amendments . 
mr president , i agree with the support of at least a certain knowledge with the rapporteur , our colleague , mr blokland . the incineration may come as a source of pollution is an important one , but she is now necessary , bearing in mind the very low rate of recycling of waste . 
first and this is the most important - it will contribute significantly to reducing emissions of dangerous substances and polluting the incineration of waste at the time of very dangerous substances to human health - from the environment . and the 
in some countries , the burning of waste , in small studiously sorted local production of heat and power production power-stations also constitutes the best solution from the point of view of the environment . 
in particular , i welcome the commitment to improve public access to information on the incineration plants and of the obligation imposed on operators to publish an annual report on their emissions . 
the operation of the portuguese and french presidencies has been constructive and the commission deserves a mention : it has contributed significantly to peculiar to render a good final product . 
the incineration of waste must be the last stage in the treatment of waste , according to the structure in , and the commission will carry out the serious efforts in order to reduce and recycle , and also in its approach to the waste that is an integrated policy for the products . 
would the council on employment and social policy has adopted unanimously , on 17 october in luxembourg , a european strategy to combat social exclusion . 
but they have also proven to be needed in connection with the failure of these is ever-increasing national health services , and is linked to the fact that they are public and to their cost , but also at higher , reducing their financing by the state , who has become cheaper financing budgets in all the member states during the 1980s and early 1990s . 
that is why , rightly , that it is so important - and this is the most important outcome of this report at the fact - that the commission draft a green paper on the short-term supplementary sickness insurance yalta did . 
the debate on health insurance in the eu must not lead to deadlock . 
according to this concept is at the needs of the insurance market , supplementary sickness for profit is to take , in such a way as important , and increasing a function of the regimes of supplement and 
these are the same medical profession , the same people , the same staff should nurses beds hospitals and the same resources public-health take appeals , which are of the patients or sold to people who pay ordinary their care . 
my congratulations to the rapporteur mr rocard . 
the section for residents are deprived of social security rules on coordination because it is not the business of insurance for workers and that it applies only to the residents . 
we refuse to accept that reform antisocial . 
health care are being funded in different ways from the member states and the role of private insurance , institutions , too . differs 
instead , our charter of fundamental rights of the old european union recognises and respects , by means of its articles 34 and 35 , the right of access to social security benefits and social services for everyone , and proclaims simultaneously residing or moving legally within the union , is entitled to social security benefits and social benefits , in accordance with community law and national laws and practices . 
the financing of the regime as well as legal foresight pension scheme is the focus of discussions on social policy in europe . but indeed also a budgetary 
the restructuring of social security systems in several member states are making a contribution to this too . 
the green paper which today are of the future . the different legislations and harmful intrusive 
the commission will immediately set in motion a study on health insurance in yield . 
i thank you for having understood that we are helping to ensure that the european union by this process forward a programme in this area , will regain its limitations and its inadequacies . despite 
people must also be placed in a situation as it should be able to acquire a qualification and adapt this qualifications . 
the countries which are not members of the euro area of convergence , which are at least submit programs a large extent similar to the stability programmes , although the objectives that are different . they want to achieve 
ultimately , we consider to what extent will the national budgets which are presented each year are compatible with the strategies in the medium term as regards more ambitious the exchequer . 
in the case of finland , the public debt of less than that objective and already is , moreover , to boil down steadily yalta did . 
on the one hand , the umts licences - as i said - have been affected with a reduction in the previous figure of debt , which makes it possible to get a public debt that lies at the level of the 60 % . practically 
inflation is undoubtedly a cause for concern . 
at this time i have the impression that the phrases used in the countries currently at three aspects . states are going 
this plan of action which sets in motion , as the government . i mean , we should set itself for public health and the requirement , the primacy of transparency . 
this meeting at this very moment , in fact , makes it possible to compare the different experiences and approaches on the programme of tests , the ban on animal meal sur and on the other provisions that are likely to be emphasised to the european level . 
we have seen a worrying increase in cases of bse have been identified in france during the past year , partly because of the introduction of tests are random . 
finally , we must not underestimate the enormous progress over recent years , in particular last year , by setting up a framework for combating bse . 
the european parliament has always been a fervent supporter of these tests , and i am counting on you to support the commission &apos;s approach . 
a strict application of these controls are concerned is , therefore , necessary , both in terms of public health and with financial support . 
my only concern on the use of meat-and-bone meal is whether or not a risk they present within the framework of the animal feed . 
it remains to be seen whether this opinion . the recent events have changed 
( applause ) 
i would hope , madam president , from this being my last speech before this house on this topic , because we need to put an end to this problem . really 
in some cases it is in fact necessary to do that , something that is a serious blow to the small farmers who are affected . 
of our grass fields - clover white vetch - now by the cap - which may provide solutions disrepair satisfactory to the safety of animal feed and foodstuffs . 
. ( pt ) as the support of the market of aid occasional or premiums on the ground from are indispensable . 
the scientific authorities clearly indicated that the development of the disease in cattle was not handled and the number of worrying was emphasised how animals become ill . 
i heard just now to speak of tests are random . 
( applause from the uen group 
even if it is a decision by france , which came from the effects or repercussions it will extend far beyond the frontiers of france . 
the health of european consumers must be considered as a top priority in all decision-making . 
a general ban on animal meal in food . that is to say , for all animals on the part of the pigs , poultry and the fish , as the number of my colleagues , some member states and are calling for it is not justified . 
madam president , i would like to ask the commission to pay less , particularly when it is inaccurate for categorical stand is taken of the forecasts for the future . it sets out 
yesterday , the coordinators of the various parts of the committee on agriculture and rural development , have declared their agreement on the proposal to devote to the fight against bse 600 million from the reserve of around 1.3 billion euros in the rest of the farm budget . 
everyone recognises that disease bse , that is now being presented as a crisis that were originally uk position french , is a european problem , a disease which is genuinely european , and that it has to be dealt with in this light and 
we must take precautionary measures are now , not only on behalf of those of us who are affected , but also on behalf of the minority of member states &apos; . &quot; doing enough 
and tomorrow with the banning of meat-and-bone meal , there are also millions of hectares in culture , which are now going to give additional default . 
i had a quick calculation of the cost per kilo . : that is 10 cents 
it is a technical putting at risk of consumers , and this cannot be tolerated . premeditation with with 
parliament votes for half the budget to promote the production process . 
furthermore , this set of regulations has been getting improvements and in keeping with the demands of europe . 
however , our country has learned a great deal over the years , as to how to get its house in order . 
france has to be banned t-bone steaks and many regions in france on the beef imported french withdrew from their schools . canteens menu 
i believe we must , today , attempting , following your discussions , to make budgetary lines in the high , both in the methods and the means , to bring them to secure this imperative . 
we are talking here of public health and , therefore , that it is important to treat grievous events as they stand , in partnership with rigorously and transparently . 
i believe that the legislation has been respected , and i do not feel , but i do not believe it is naïve crucial is a general ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry . 
mr martinez has participated in the first and i would like , here in the disposal of our fellow member , who has been made by his minority opinion at the first commission , the commission writes böge . 
at a later date in the longer term , the objective is to define a common asylum system global . 
on 12 december , the united nations will sign at a global convention palermo on organised crime with a protocol on trafficking in human beings . 
the programme on gender equality for the next five years that the commission has put before us is based on five areas , one has to do with the violence and to human rights . we are waiting for , in this area , cooperation of the governments , local authorities and non-governmental organisations , so that , over the next five years will be supplemented by the member states . in all programmes 
however , we also have put in place , following the plan for stability and growth , the stability programmes . 
externally , it is true that there is a problem , and in response to mr nogueira has said - which is indirectly , we must not forget , that the level of savings in europe is to be several times that of the united states . 
during the campaign of charges , high levels of sulphur dioxide , have been found to some of the trouble spots of the city . 
questions nos 25 and 28 will be answered in writing . 
( the sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. ) 
after the mass unemployment , exclusion from years 80-90 risk that the evil which newly-appointed europe during the next decade . 
that is how we will have a common basis , because it is no longer be able to find common difficult to define the concept of social exclusion . 
it would be useful to use some of the increase in the financial package which is demanded in this report in order to finance studies comparative on how these issues could be managed . 
for my part , i think the exclusion and poverty are , by our society , and we are collectively responsible . 
so as to arrive at one and the economic and social cohesion , we need , in addition to a high level of employment , from a level of social protection high . 
the fact is that social exclusion is an obstacle to economic growth while a society based on inclusion promotes economic growth and prosperity of each . 
naturally , the policy of labour market policy is part of this fight . 
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent contribution to the identification of the causes and the size of the poverty , about social realities adapted theme of which the framework in a not cruelty never happens dilutes as vast and as that of social exclusion . abstract 
the proposed action programme has a legal base , article 137 of the treaty of amsterdam , and the lisbon council said to us a new mandate . 
but i agree that the word &quot; poverty is a politically very strong word - ( el ) and i agree that something must be involved , when this is possible , to that of social exclusion &quot; &apos; into the text of the proposal . 
finally , i should like to answer your concerns regarding the involvement of various institutions in the implementation of those who operate and the programme . 
the proposed directive is a logical consequence of the strategy of the european union to double the share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption by 2010 . 
in this respect , the member states have the ability to calculate the exact amount of their contributions to achieving the objectives of respective the union now , according to the principle of the sharing of burdens , and i would also say in this area of the sharing of opportunities . 
it consists of a summit which intends to put a brake on climate change and in which the kyoto protocol will rise . ordeal his 
renewable energy is by far the most important source of energy currently used in the world . 
however , these must remain reasonable and , in my judgment in this connection , we should not be allocated a specific period . that in order to 
that is so , be political , is to make possible a competition between the two instruments , whilst offering guaranteed prices and harmonisation of all that lies certificate . 
this is the reason for which i tabled an amendment seeking to apply to waste incineration the emissions standards annex 5 of the very strict revised directive . 
many of us feel that a lot of energy produced from genetically waste should be included . 
in my opinion , the promotion of renewable energy sources must be accompanied by a programme for energy saving of a modern , and why this point for us to represent first dependency &apos;un safety risk . 
similarly , i wish to inform the commissioner that ireland will very soon to be competitive in terms of energy of wind power . 
the debate on renewable energy should not turn into populist campaign against nuclear power . 
this is why government commitment is required if we are to receive such funding for all . 
renewable energies are no exception . 
that is what we need to do at european level . 
mr president , i should like to begin by congratulating mrs rothe for her wonderful work she has done and all the members who have spoken and who have also amended the text proposed to us on many occasions in parliament and the council . 
the commission cannot accept this part of amendment no 27 , as well as amendments nos 11 , 54 , 55 and 57 which it refers . 61 
with regard to the principles on which the future system of support must be based , the commission can accept harmonised those parts of amendments nos 37 and 38 which state that it should take account of environmental objectives of the treaty , from the experience acquired in the support schemes which have shown that they were positive , as well as efficient and geographical indications . des 
the widows of war are forced to bring up children on their own , to take only oligarchic old men . 
the participation process local aux peace-building and reconciliation is an important one . 
there are grounds for us in relation to this type of situation by offering to women , in the refugee camps , a special protection through the medium of the division of the camps . 
finally , mr president , i would like to express my disappointment regarding des overshadowed manoeuvrings deployed which have to weaken the paragraph on the rights and freedom of 12.00 choice for rape victims , and face of war . 
so let us be practical . 
we cannot allow this to continue because the rights , the priorities and interests of women are in the peace process is all too often ignored , and in the few cases in which women in decision-making in the fields , they are extremely effective . 
i read a report a few priorities . for my part 
i am convinced that if women are concerned , palestine and israel , it had to make a decisive say and their role to play in the peace process , a just and lasting solution be found , in all likelihood , could have for the palestinian question , and we do not face the current crisis , we would find the result of seven years of negotiations would be wasting our time . unsafest 
mr president , the report contains many elements of mrs theorin , and it seems to me that we should bizarre avoid giving one to believe that the armed forces are a kind of social service and that their main concern is to be politically correct . 
mr. president , at present , tell me , representing the council or the high representative for cfsp . 
creating the oppositions between sexes , as already devoted to it is in this house this evening is , in my opinion , an approach which is not a prescriptive nor peaceful , constructive . 
mr president , it is certain that this is a first phase , the participation of women , where the legislation are starting to be done in the various programmes , they arise when it does not become the norm . 
i therefore believe that these two means into account in order to carry out a study may enter universal area and the attempts made in certain countries . deployed examine 
in some cases they are exploited and misled . 
i am about to discuss a few of the objections made . 
it also maintains that this would actually be created , in the labour market , on the cheap . a class 
in austria , and particularly in my region , has been applied for three years now a project financed by the eu whereby a servicing designed for women is extremely successful council is acting as mediators for mobile yalta did . 
now that it seems that the dark pages of the last decade , your continued presence there in front of our assembly is a sign of our common desire to see a full part in this was quickly yugoslavia rediscover european family . 
but today , following the leap decisive political of 24 september or even more decisive strivings on 5 october , the foreign policy has set itself a goal yugoslavian adopting an overall approach is important , then in the face of the group of nations that make up the european union , followed up to accession . 
the most important task to accomplish on now is the establishment of a network of relations in the republic of yugoslavia . in-house democratic 
a democratic state is allowed by a common one montenegro and serbia to muslims and the albanians to live in one country which allows us to stand together in order to build the common state equality . 
i thank you , mr president , for this contribution which , as you can see , has our house . impressed 
mr. president , on page 27 of the annex to the minutes , i would point out that my vote in favour of amendment no 20 of the morillon report . 
my aim in drawing up this report , was to move forward a proposal which is politically mature eminently sensible and , for both practical and the citizen . 
another important amendment was that on the proposal to include in the regulation not only the council , commission and parliament but also all the bodies outside the economy . 
it is also a very good thing that the institutions are obliged to have , or rather , that although people has the opportunity to people who are also to have an exchange of documents in the european union and not on the territory in the european union live , which are not citizens of the european union . 
that is why the text of mr cashman , in these is not just any old report . 
unfortunately , the request that had had to prevent all possible eventualities and to provide for the regulation as comprehensive as possible and as broad as possible was unquestionably fittest . 
mr president , many things have been smart of talk about the context of this report . 
( de ) mr president , the cashman report can be summarised as follows : the power of the citizens on bureaucracy . 
this is a point on which parliament has adopted a position for the motion , and on which the emphasis in its remit , for it is certainly important indeed . 
we need now , during our negotiations with the council and commission , that we put up a proposal and that we reach an outcome . 
from what is said that these rules for public access to documents has hardly been touched upon in the college , and brought up to now been taken for granted as if the issue essentially administrative . 
this is about the rights of citizens which we are dealing with , this time . 
we members of the bonino list , we consider , at the same time , that we should not fall into excesses reverses necessitates a six-hour instant access to information or for port indiscriminate opinions that have no value too . 
this point of the regulation opens up the way to arbitrary decision-making . 
they say one thing , but are we doing another . 
the stakes are the rule of law , a mode of administration and democratic functioning efficient . 
this is something which we must hold - most importantly , to consider the quality of parliament . 
( fr ) we have at any rate need of a new era of the information and we shall have a great opportunity ; we still need to show our members of parliament , no real identity . 
in fact , it is important for security for citizens to have itself the possibility of assessing their trust in the defence of europe on the basis of facts and evidence . 
i realise that the council was in july , a grave mistake , by stating that all the documents that were strictly servicemen confidential 
that is why the basic principle is the opening up , but it must be reconciled with the safeguarding of the public interest and the respect of certain rights which deserve special protection . 
making it incumbent upon the institutions to disseminate such internal papers produce , in many cases , could do nothing other than a certain confusion in people . 
at this stage in the legislative procedure , it is premature to adopt a position on the appropriateness of a direct relationship between the ranking and access to documents , as proposed in amendment no 29 , or the inclusion in the present regulation for this purpose . &apos; standards of 
mr cashman is right in saying that this is not the commission to tell the political groups what position they have to take here in plenary . 
i should like to underline the key role played by malta in the current negotiations with a view to the eu membership of the republic of malta . 
we are and yet not for banks the right to determine for themselves but , in practice of capital requirements , we would be very close , if we do not keep a very close eye on them as regards their may bear systems internal . 
( pt ) mr president , i would like to point out to the house that the amendments on behalf of the gue / ngl group , i am presenting as rapporteur , have resulted from conversations with the council and the commission , and are also the support by the coordinators of the political groups represented in the committee on employment and social affairs . 
in this case we are talking about here is a very important piece of legislation , and they are also a question here of articles which are important . 
( applause from the ppe-de group ) 
mr. president , in contrast to mrs theorin , i do not want to suggest is that the votes and the debates in say from my agenda volition expediency staffing . 
i am one of the members who have , rather , a presence . honourably 
i have voted against the slaughter of whole herds as i do not believe that this is the best way to eradicate bse . 
to take measures at european level , 
second lesson to themselves . so on quality . a certain degree of self-sufficiency in food production . it will only survive in europe against a background of worldwide doctrine of free trade . 
the union , as a whole , must get its act together because it would not tolerable for a country to finally looks draconian and its economy , whilst others endangered lead to situations that would carry on their activities . continue normally 
the cap has always favoured the intensification of production or &quot; in the production and the &apos; gradual verticalisation the concentration of the earth , to serve the interests of the food industry and , fundamentally , of the large multinationals in food . 
this is also an attitude of defiance towards the european union which , in their eyes , is unable to guarantee the safety of food products introduced onto the market . 
i would like to remind you of the decisive role played by our group uen allowing them to take place , and the motion for a resolution we have tabled . a very coherent position 
blokland report ( a5-0321 / 2000 ) 
the parliament has yet been successful on one further point is that the success of the waste incineration plants must be expressly excluded from the scope of the directive . 
i am absolutely convinced that , in the governments of per cent of cases 
but , unfortunately , good intentions do not form a policy , if only out of whistleblowing . 
too many of our fellow citizens have left to the brink of the road . 
europe does that can be economically strong if it is socially just , we can only welcome this development . 
it would be more effective , to combat exclusion , for example a guaranteed minimum wage of creating a european . 
thanks to a fresh approach , radical , i strongly believe that we can actually get it through this critical juncture , but also achieve our ultimate goal , and poverty and social exclusion in entirely eradicate the north-west . 
i am thinking of the freezing nights and to the winter cold days in europe , and it is also in the north or south , where many people are elderly , for lack of financial resources , are , unfortunately , to save money . constraints to switch off their heating 
and i am of course in favour of the active promotion of renewable energy . 
so i thank my colleague mrs rothe for her sound report . 
this applies especially to the people who do not have the means and which therefore , have the prime concern to see to it that the cost of their families are still so low as possible . 
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance . 
we differ only on paragraph 5 of this resolution , but that does not constitute a key area . it seems to us that divergence by agreeing to this point the european parliament adopts a paternalistic attitude excessively yalta did . 
we believe , not only now , but since the creation of the , who some people seek to diminish 
this is one of the questions that raises , it is obvious that a feeling , not only in this chamber but unanimous not available on individual members who , by their among many other origin , the processes of a great deal of sympathy are looking with cooperation and consolidation of the institutions in countries that we regard as our own . 
in our cooperation with the region , we paid particular attention to all the institutions able to support regional integration , the general secretariat of the system of integration of central america , the court of justice and , more specifically , is one of our aims , who parlacen take priority . 
that is why our concern and sorrow of when we have been very much alive , saw the political , economic and human slow shipwreck of that country , by the military junta of general gueï . orchestrated 
current dans the bankruptcy of the model , the responsibility of western ivorian obviously exists , and overwhelmingly yalta did . 
the leaders are now a chance , and surely it would be unused ! news 
the european union must also make sure that none of its members , with its ancient based settlements - and i deliberately repeat relationships based solely on again here - or of economic interests racks geo-strategic yalta did . 
when those in favour of to the streets to call for the fraudulent elections , they deal with the protest was violently suppressed . 
the european union has a duty and has declared its intention to contribute in other respects , just , to go about their peaceable free and transparent for elections in december and to local elections will be held in january . 
mr president , the european union recently deplored the fact , within various declarations , the excesses of the regime of general gueï and has also expressed regret at the exclusion of the main opposition candidates direct of elections on 22 october , which has , in large part , disqualify constricted the credibility of this electoral process . 
dimitrakopoulos and viii ( 2000 ) by mr vinci and others , on behalf of the gue / ngl group ; 
mr president , at the october part-session , commissioner patten told me , whereas it was in response to my question about burma , that if we in this country , the implementation of the meeting 
in reality , as has already been said , the situation in burma is in the process become more marked . it is extraordinary that a democratic leader aung san suu kyi as important as we are still suffering from persecution and that the democratic league must cannot carry out its duties in order to restore democracy and , more so normally when that country continues to receive financial input , the absence of which , precisely to our lack of freedom , trade union rights . 
i know that the idea for the fact that we know at the door of this scheme will provide it with a small vicious calamitous thors was and i sincerely hope the comfort suggestions both by mr deva and mrs kinnock and respected by the commission . will be accepted 
vietnam in a 
it is one of our partners . this is why we cannot continue to remain silent on the situation . 
we have adopted this resolution and we were able to note that she had given rise to a few minor improvements . 
israel is on this one of the most striking examples in the history of the world , as they show that things are not as simple as that . 
just think , too , to a negation of the recommendations of the special rapporteur of the united states on the printing its lack of religious intolerance , and the free expression of that exists . at the censorship of a media 
the commission fully shares the concerns of members of parliament and has come round to the many criticisms voiced , categorically today , on the way in which the military regime gets used to deny all the principles contained in the universal declaration of human rights . 
i fully share the concern of some members about the problems that they have described . in spite of the fact that approximately eur 23 000 people have already been released again - we must continue to by virtue of general 
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m. 
the eu has a unique opportunity to act as a pioneer in these changes and to promote a society which is environmentally sustainable , we would not have to cope with involving where floods partly due to our own inability to accept the consequences of such action . 
the commission must make haste to energy and its funds in order to ensure that those in the regions most affected by flooding . this in immediately support that have been affected the kindness of tools such as the erdf and the eaggf guarantee section . 
taking into consideration her absolutely exceptional , demand of the disaster in the resolution that we tabled together against the other groups , even though he is perfectly justified y already recently -the 26th – one of this house on these issues and that a parliament resolution which was adopted on this occasion . also , has been guilty 
as you know , we are facing a fundamental problem : the legal basis for taking action . 
the next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance . 
mr. president , i really am extremely concerned at this issue and have heard many debates on the topic as long in the committee on employment and social affairs by the committee on economic and monetary affairs . 
i understand that this addition can count on the approval of the other groups . 
we believe that the objective should be to strengthen both the health care that the system of social protection , and to guarantee that there will be to the concept of universal service , substantive expression of thanks to the medical attention and measures for the prevention of high quality at every single citizen , with special attention being paid for the inhabitants of remote areas , under an island , or a public insurance single system and social matters . sanitary 
however , i would stress the fact that all the other measures for health protection are not a matter for the european union , but of the member states and that health care systems are still being of the exclusive competence of member states . 
the remainder of what it proposes of these is to enable the wounds that air- that choice . 
at least , the majority of my group voted against and we also ensured that the vote on the report has not implemented in the last part-session , but should be postponed until today . 
this means that if we manage to wind up this evening , on first reading with the council and in conjunction with the commission , we can , of course do this , but we shall not give up from the outset of our rights . 
but if you will , lastly , let us assume that is not sold the referee and accept the idea that one &apos;s opponent à the texts of the commission and the rapporteur is in keeping with a real problem , in the words and growing , and also that of those consultations simultaneous with those of the basel committee to the opportunity we have here in europe . so be 
these are , however , the small and medium-sized enterprises that create most new jobs and which keep the most jobs , which already exist . 
that is why it is important not to reject what goes on in basel , although it is clear that we have a legislative procedure , to express its position . 
the way in which we must manage to keep the existing institutional balance is , for us , a fundamental point in this process . 
l house will forgive me , whereas in the evening is those published at the parliamentary sitting , i now come to go to some to draw my inspiration melancholy well to home . 
the public must be given the length and breadth of the confidence in the ombudsman , and be sure that it is fair in its investigations . 
i would like to thank mrs almeida garrett for her commitment , on this important matter . 
in the past , the ombudsman , that we have just discussed , has received many complaints about the lack of transparency in recruitment and it is a problem in the opportunities for extremely serious , because we fully share the opinion of the ombudsman according to which a procedure for the first contact recruitment constitutes very often the case of young men and women of the union with the european institutions . 
if there were of the lack of coherence , the applicant must have the right to point out . 
we must not contribute to that can also be applied to stone devices institutions as well as the commission or the court of justice . different 
the petitions committee notes that the european commission has informed the mediator implemented since 1 july 2000 . the recommendation 
these are amendments , which represent a pragmatic and very thoughtful consideration that has been clear about this , that is , the only real reform , reform that the european institutions that is worthy of the name should adopt with regard to the procedures for staff recruitment . 
a process of selection process and without resorting to transparent confidentiality incommunicado or is the hallmark of a democracy that has confidence in it . 
for example , there is already a way that the candidates of examination , that the criteria we have a serious challenge before questionnaires generals of assessment should be sent to the candidates and , upon request , that the list of candidates . the composition of the panel received or competitions in the official journal , and should be published in the case of open competitions and upon the commission &apos;s website , where today competitions or restricted . 
only a few months ago , president prodi stated that this option would be to all , starting in july 2000 . contests 
for this we are for the moment on the minutes . 
( applause ) 
agreed , therefore , to achieve higher weighting by 10 % - for example - but in all cases and that is absolutely quecedo all circumstances . 
in my view , we can be proud , as the european parliament for having placed the question of a european police college on track . 
we know that some member states still support the establishment of the college as merely a permanent network of national institutes , but we assume that the majority accepts this proposal as a step which would contribute to the creation of an institution which is within a period of three . maximum solid 
the dutch word reminds me of a long-running american television station in the police . comical sur 
let us ensure , why we have a european police college , in the form it takes , as highlighted in the report by mr posselt , founded on the need for respect of human rights and promote the high-quality help develop their civil and police force . in the culture of our 
as long as this aspect is still unknown , i must say frankly that i cannot even approve the principle . 
i note that the rapporteur wants to change the term &quot; of the services responsible law enforcement senior members of the senior members &quot; in &quot; law applying attributions police ’ , which is with centuries-old , probably a good idea . 
for me - come from a political environment , it is very interesting to hear him say once more , with the same , the same concerns . hysteria 
one could call it , but it has succeeded in the police gentle heal the wounds from a civil war and at making the idea of the law and a credible and order . 
i prefer a trained and organised on a small scale , police force of the society signals constantly supplied from it must operate . 
the commission is prepared to perform this task , if anything has decided that . 
it is particularly important to emphasise that the european police college &apos; s taking office , of which is planned for 1 january 2001 . this is not simply a network of national institutes of police training destined for the member states of the eu , but that it involves the applicant countries of central and eastern europe . themselves work 
. ( el ) according to the letter before people say to me , either , which is the path they do not happen in the process to take if europol is not corrected speedily its course . 
there are constitutional problems in some member states , particularly in germany and austria . 
it is a fact that a europe without borders has contributed to the increased number of marriages between persons of a different nationality , just as well of the european union , but originating from third countries . 
other than commissioners diverge unhappily a vengeance accumulated yalta did . 
but if it is true that this is a great step forward from this perspective , it is equally true that i agree with what mrs banotti and others who regret that its scope is limited to the protection of children from recognized as such by the law . weddings 
could i ask you to clarify your view about article 17 ? 
with regard to the proposals put forward by certain major federations , as regards certain requirements , which manifest themselves in favour of a sporting protocol enabled them to escape the basic rules of the treaty , including those relating to the free movement and competition , there is reason to emphasise that this exemption , as it stands , would be disproportionate to the goals to be achieved . manifestly 
the eu must not ‘ phooey ’ and too bad if the prohibition of the system of transfers cause irreparable damage to the football . 
i would hope that before you overlook confers new powers , the commission to use the people it has available . 
provided that the details of implementing it respect the rules , such an appropriate measure seems to be on the one with the current community law , which aims to eliminate the distortion of competition as to lay down for the taxation of equitable mechanisms of infrastructure costs to road hauliers and harmonise the systems of the european union . in the bosom of deductions 
perhaps it would be advantageous in time to say quite simply what the british government has proposed and also what really he is proposing , bearing in mind the crisis in the road haulage sector in other eu countries in all the uk and european . 
when is an important proposal of this kind is being put forward , we in this house should have the opportunity to reflect on it and to discuss that as soon as possible , not necessarily for the last time . 
foresight is called for . 
as regards your first point , mr miller , that proposal was mooted in the house by the president and it is parliament which has given its assent to the amendment of the agenda for today . 
i agree that heavy goods vehicles are a special case . irishman 
i am expressing to his family and relatives and friends , with all those in spain , believe in the strength of democracy itself , my deepest sympathy . 
i the note , mr dell &apos;alba . 
in order not to make it possible that the mandate of the buenos aires plan of action , which will be valid right up to the conference . it expires ultimately without success , or without cop 6 a row , the parties have decided to suspend the conference in may and to pursue the cop 6 2001 . 
in addition to the continued development of coordination within the european union , intensifying the contacts with other parties . 
many countries , and in particular , the groups , environmentalists this as an escape route . enormous looking upon 
the fact that the way out , to say the least regard has been followed up by mr prescott vocal by new proposals to the union &apos;s position of the americans , who shows that the french presidency was right to give up . 
and if the mechanism for clean development operates receives each year between five and 25 000 million dollars exemption to end . 
next , china must stabilise its emissions , and india will be able to arrive at rates emission 2 yalta did . 
the usa are the largest per capita . polluters 80-member 
the committee on the environment of this parliament has , in the past , in order to respond to the front row mid1993 problem of climate change . 
but i would not want to fall into the rows of people , and avoid this kind of discussion totally negative . 
kyoto must not remain an empty balloon . promise 
on the other hand , i believe that , among those companies and the economic actors , who take this problem seriously , and which would have liked to have provided some rules in this house , we expect them to play too , is losing out . 
to put it in plain language when we come to take stock , we can say that amongst the three sides , only the european union has reached an agreement and policy on climate change . 
what we need now , of course contain a number of clear rules to regulate market operational of trade in emission rights , who of only 12 000 million dollars . to be worth 
the ministers are all aware that they cannot be excluded from the huge task of combating climate change ; it was also clear during the meeting of the hague . 
the french president on the presidency will come himself present you with on 12 december . 
from now the european union is close to an agreement on the relaxing of closer cooperation . 
by contrast , the idea of a reference to the charter of fundamental rights in article 6 , the european parliament &apos;s position , in its recommendation of 14 november , and that we have also , as presidency of the igc , on the table has been rejected by several member states . vigorously 
this we will have fulfilled the mandate laid down by the cologne european council and the union will have a reference is very strong , marking the rights and values in a clear manner , to which it believed . 
at last , the nice european council will give you an overview of the priority that the french presidency attaches to economic and social matters and to all the subjects on which the union can provide specific answers to the concerns of europeans . 
moreover , on the basis of the conclusions of feira , calling for the implementation of a plan of action for an information society e-europe accessible to all , the council has been working on indicators of progress . 
this debate a number of aspects and i should like to outline three of them . firstly , the need to conclude the intergovernmental conference by the adoption of a treaty that really adds value . next , the aspect of our policy of safety which deals with crisis management . lastly , the need to mark out the route beyond nice . 
there is much to be done before we have a reasonable solution . 
we therefore need a new weighting of votes , according to which a majority of states , not the majority of people , who would be taken up ; it is not , at the criminal court to decide here to a clear principle of democracy must prevail . 
i totally agree with president prodi that we have a historic opportunity which we must not waste . 
my group , at this stage , would prefer a re-weighting of votes , the double majority , but you have explained that others are being kept under examination . 
our group strongly supports the idea of our the constitutionalisation of the founding treaties . this means that the reform of the treaties must occur with full transparency and with the participation of civil society . 
the strengthening of democracy would be necessary extension of the right of codecision by parliament . 
let us not , tomorrow , with a new multilateral agreement on investment or a new agricultural negotiation will be after the seattle conference . 
the internal policy and the policy of justice will be the subject of majority decision-making as from 2004 . 
mr president , nothing that the title of this agenda item is the importance of rule 133 evokes already in the debate on the extension of qualified majority voting . 
it is particularly sad to be allowed to get into a situation where the large and small countries are at odds with each other . purpose-built 
everyone must make an end of the road if it is required that the qualified majority to be to enable the union of unblocked welcoming countries into membership . 
parliament has also demonstrated that it is a good partner when drawing up the charter , and it would be the prime minister blair particularly heartened by admitted it publicly . 
if the summit in nice were to decide , for example , that these people would take part in the next european elections , it could help to put pressure on the eu for that enlargement becomes a reality . 
i have elected not to the citizens of the european areas , if we extend qmv to five areas which it will make important and which - the trade , social policy , the law , the internal affairs , the structural policy and taxation , to mention only the most important . 
we are today on the eve of the conclusion , the progress made and results have not obtained tractable escaped , but we must be frank : in almost ten months of the intergovernmental conference on these essential questions , opinions which they have been unable to , there has not , mr védrine , moved closer together , without even mentioning the found understandings desire of some of the subjects in the resolution of 13 april by parliament which are mentioned have not even been touched on , whether with regard to the management of the economy or the institutional implications of a common military defence , 
the governments who have lost sight of the urgency of the reforms for they are blinded by their own group in the new relations between the powers . 
mr president , i would like to remind the council and the commission , and clearly for parliament , the resolution on ‘ better law-making ’ , which we adopted on 26 october . 
i think that all the speakers are concerned about the outcome of the european council in nice . 
finally , not only will the charter of fundamental rights is not included in the text of the treaty so far this exists , but it is not even agree to make reference to rule 6 . 
if i have gathered in no way opposed to , in fact , to the aspirations and rights of some of those countries wishing to join the community , in 2002 , it would no , i believe , not in their interests , or in the interests of the member states , to reach this stage that one does sans ensures , firstly , an ordered transition , causing a minimum number of distortions of the current member states . on the economies 
everyone will have to sacrifice some of exceptions to if we are to have an outcome at nice . 
we know that a definitive solution must be found for the european elections in 2009 , in other words for the parliamentary term , all said and done , due to run up until 2014 . 
i am of the opinion that it will take at least be made in nice in this parliament accept the compromise that they gain permission to attend our demand is to say the combination of the charter with article 6 ( 2 ) . 
public opinion , be it in the eu and in the candidate countries will not accept the prospect of nice leftovers or a second igc in 2004 . 
it all . the european parliament blames 
if we now take , mr president-in-office of the council , that the french presidency has a crucial role to play at this level , we must also recognise that a few days before the summit , we are still at a standstill . 
apart from the overall picture of the forthcoming igc , a small detail , which has , alas , important concerns me . 
despite this , i should like to point out , even if this exercise is very useful that , because this raises a great deal to be fighting , that i see it and many suggestions pertinent question marks overall far too negative . the tone 
we are making every effort , if i may say so . 
they accept its principle , account must avail themselves , but the prospect of the interests they have to defend democratic and they consider that the legitimate requirements are not yet been met . 
that is why it is so important to strengthen the community method at nice , the value of the european institutions - council , parliament and commission - and the way to work together . 
such a way of proceeding is violating the rules of this parliament , constitutes a blatant lack of courtesy towards a guest and could have very serious repercussions eminent yalta did . 
i will forward the names to the president and i would ask him to investigate and to take the actions that need to be put in place to prevent the again we find in our parliament to such people , then , again with fro-ing disturb and threaten the aid of europe ! deputies 
on almost the same day , a man , who has , of parliament &apos;s main cypriot already visited the european parliament , mr wuori has been refused a visa turk a time when he was travelling with a given , a tripartite meeting in istanbul , between , greek and turkish cypriots , namely a very peaceful . 
it demonstrates that the verbal abuse conducts physical violence . à 
in 1966 , ernest , his brother and myself have been lost , with some members of the teaching staff university sixty barcelona by le franco régime . 
mr gorostiaga , you are a disgrace to this parliament . 
( a5-0339 / 2000 by mrs lalumière , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the creation of a common european policy on security and defence cologne and helsinki &#91; 2000 / 2005 ( ini ) &#93; ; 
even the orders of engagement in a national , for every country to participate or not to participate in has sovereign powers to decide a military intervention . 
firstly , a brief comment on one crucial problem , relations of the new european , with nato . 
similarly , we need to clarify the status of the high representative and of the commissioner with responsibility vis-à-vis the triangle existing of external relations . 
subsequently , permanent arrangements with third countries and with nato . 
three common strategies have been adopted since may 1999 on russia , ukraine and the mediterranean . 
there has been equally a european union / ukraine summit and the political dialogue on 15 september fruitful extends now to the questions arms exports , security and disarmament , conventional topic underlined by the osce to be a problem with that country . 
i would not wish to conclude without recalling the running of this national recapitulation union on the use of so-called now playing up to major issues , notably in the matter of human rights or that are comprehensive horizontal thick and fast , we still need to work where for coherence of european policy in the international arena , and civil society . linking 
i am happy to continue with this in setting out the results of our currency today vous conference commitment capacities on 20 november . 
therefore this input , out of a quantitative approach , to respond fully to the overall objective defined by the council . 
between now and 2003 , when the bodies set up will be able to exercise both their job , the european union will not be capable of carrying out certain gradually petersberg missions . 
we all know that the origins of the european union and the main objective of the founding fathers was to prevent europe fell into a new civil war . 
it is necessary to go on increasing the coherence and efficiency in all the pillars of the activities of the european union . external 
once again , i would refer to the media in my country , which sometimes tend have à objectives and balanced , and who seem to find it rather difficult to grasp this distinction . 
the dictatorship sur was cut off for submission to the only route supply valley &apos;s and the plain of where the forces are concentrated by commander massoud , but also a significant proportion of displaced people and refugees . 
the rapid reaction force will be destined to fulfil the petersberg tasks . 
that is why it seems a little pointless to sort out , for example , into the detail of the organisation of the european ones . air 
the same ideas , circling around the theme of yet as transparent as possible , were expressed in the cashman report , which we have adopted with a large majority , a fortnight ago in strasbourg . 
i would like to hear what richard about that and ask him in his opinion the role of the european parliament should be if this does not exist . protocol secrecy 
it cannot continue . 
nevertheless , the &apos; republic of fear &apos; vote , used for years over epithet striking designate of saddam &apos;s reign of terror , is still that many european politicians , be that we would seriously underestimated even here in the eu parliament . 
i would particularly like to highlight the progress made under the auspices of the french presidency in the field of the common foreign and security policy and in the field of defence , and i would like to stress , because , during the debate on these steps forward . the european council in nice , earlier on , there were some reservations on the progress made during this presidency . this also in a global 
i know , minister , that you are on this point , that you come sceptical at again to say no , as you have already done in other circumstances . paris this parliament , but , above and beyond all political affiliation , is persisting and try to impose this view . 
the concentration on management purely reactive crises common foreign and security policy has had in a very bad position . 
this means that the prime objective of the council must be to combine our efforts for reducing the export of weapons in the unstable regions , that a fair trade policy must be put into place , that there must be an aid to the sustainable development and above all , support the democratic forces within the civil society . 
we also very much welcome the efforts made by mr patten , who is very popular , just as mr solana here at home , which shows that something is finally about the initiatives . 
i must say that we can support many elements of the brok report , particularly the importance attached to enlargement of the european union . 
thirdly , although i welcome the rapid reaction force , the prospect of europe must be made clear , because we will only have a chance of getting there . qu 
mr president , we are discussing today , of two reports a political issue that needs to be , because the important , essentially concern the common foreign and security policy . 
we will never be neutral and philosophically in any event , we must not be confused with the neutrality military one . this concept 
i ask myself whether it would not have been possible to tighten the criticism and even to threaten the country which , more than anything else , of sanctions is supporting this regime and without the help of which the taliban would fall . that is to say pakistan , and 
mr. president , it says in item 31 of the brok report on foreign policy and security policy the following message : &apos; stresses the need for the democratic legitimacy of russia , and the knowledge that there is a political union between russia and belarus , its chairman and his government strong need for democratic reform clear terms the reaffirm notably in the light of the report in belarus , the parliamentary troika of the european union , the council of europe and the osce has been presented with , on 16 october 2000 as well . &quot; minsk 
the question of the point : this concept is adopted as early as 1992 . 
there will still be of the forms of rapprochement with the national parliaments need to invent that perspective , but what is , in any event , at a range of our hands and that represents a turning point , which we can , i think all the others , be pleased , is that , which make up the union , which united fifteen is constructing a political reality , these reports in a positive light by upsetting world influence opted to , these nations fifteen empower to act together in those cases where violence defies our values . 
after the reports by the independent experts , the commission , at the instigation of mr kinnock , proposed a reform of its operation in a white paper . 
now through the fabric of substance , it is mentioned that in parallel with systematically any legislative procedure , all the budgetary decisions have to be taken within the framework of procedures between annual meetings and of the interinstitutional agreement of reference . 
it gives me great satisfaction that our committee has given the findings of the bourlanges report on externalisation in the letter of amendment . occasions 
he is going to be followed by many other reports , and i promise that these few weeks of work , in which is rich , i would hope that this is a consultation system for the future . retained 
that is the basis of the new philosophy for management of the commission : to accept responsibility for each individual will be called administrative office , the regularity and legality of all its actions . 
mr. president , it gives me particular pleasure to be at last - and i stress the word &apos; finally &apos; – in a position to present this report this evening . 
such is the heart of what we are trying to do here . 
the commission be today in a position to fulfil its tasks and , beyond that , the political field - that are in the treaty ? devolved 
we shall continue in the spring onwards of the conclusions from nice and so on the basis of the new commission proposals . 
there are , however , we will give a vote of confidence in the commission so that it is made clear as much as possible , the scope of its proposal . 
the reform process has taken and implemented , and this is set out the reports the commission . regular 
the payment of bills are paid by the european union must comply with than in the wider world . the same practices 
in our view , the staff increases for , if you consider the resolution is too hesitant tasks which are linked to enlargement to the current is , it is explicit that sort of increase in staff levels will be needed in future . most important 
it is for that reason that the new rules must be examined on the basis of their implementability . 
the commission , a fundamental institutional body of the union of the current system , has been doing , with all its structure , desired by parliament and council . the community policy 
we are opposed to the other amendments which , may be , do nothing to the report , may , we must all be mad . plunging 
accordingly , the commission proposals – the white paper - by commissioner kinnock , promoted have the support of our political group . 
late payments are accumulating and obstacles are well known . 
we have all been able to see the effect of which is concerned , or the paralysis effect paralysis total - which have also brought with it the culture of fear in the committee - i refer to services and civil servants . 
mr. president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , i shall be brief but i should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs before continuing , yalta did . 
this debate gives me an opportunity , too , to present an updated picture of the progress that the most recent in matters of implementation of our strategy for modernising and further preparation of the improvements that we have foreseen , enhancements eight months in our strategy . outlined 
if i had more time , i would of course be delighted to address the issues raised , and i am sure that the opportunity . 
other elements have been in the process of design , others still remain to be supported and implemented by the decisions of parliament and the council . 
the commission should be conveyed to abide by late payments and this is included among its objectives . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. 
we will see why the next year when the evaluation we requested on the results of the us will be presented . reform 
the part of this one in the aid was , thirty years ago , international community , by 7 % , this is , at 17 % is in evidence today . 
we want to give them clearer objectives . 
the commission must also ensure that this takes place at international level . 
in accordance with this report is concerned , poverty and under-development continue to make up lost ground and many people are still unable to exercise their right to live in dignity . inalienable 
the process of implementing the decision taken in may by the commission in relation to the reform of external relations is progressing well . 
she is also necessary to ensure that programmes can , in the future , to be easily administered by our delegations and made more accessible to our partners . 
( a5-0342 / 2000 ) by mr ortuondo larrea , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive 94 / 57 / modifying council laying down rules and standards for the bodies authorized to make inspection and the visit of the vessels and activities at sea ( com ( 2000 ) relevant administrations / 2000 - 2000 / 0066 ( cod ) ) 97 
indeed , on the basis of proposals we made in february , the european commission &apos;s proposals are with all speed . 
all these proposals relate to the very essence of the regulations on maritime transport , and i would like to recall here that , in addition to the three proposals that have to be debated here today , the erika ii package of measures , as mr else said , gayssot will , next week . according to mr modrow , discussed it 
there has been since then , sadly , many other maritime disasters , as we know only too well . 
thirdly , we state , and we are not far from it , the only ones to do so , whether a boat should be both dangerous detained only to be permitted to go back to the sea . 
i should like to add that the commission &apos; s initiative to present this position is important , because it has played like a sword of damocles , effective pressure on the international maritime organisation ( imo ) . ( pt ) as in order to try to be finalised . 
on the other , of inspections will be imposed only when the deadline is met by tax inspectors , do not , which can have exclusive and specialized no link with the ship owner , and that it does not control the organism of classification of the vessel . 
furthermore , even if the direct dumping of industrial materials , including the pillar unprofessional munitions , is considered as obsolete servicemen largely a practice which has been abandoned by member states , these munitions and a real threat to still represent materials industrial fishing industry and in some cases be a threat to security of men . 
the cooperation includes exchanges of information and the summary of places from dumping of munitions . 
strong action must be conducted on the issue of flags of convenience and , for example , member &apos; in the case of france , and against futuna of ships , in the course of the 36 months beaten culminate these directives , the flag state &apos; s , as it stands in the table of the average for all and delays superiors assets in the annual report , published paris memorandum blacklist beneath heading yalta did . 
well then , please accept this proposal . 
that is why i ask you , in turn , like to conclude this issue as rapidly as possible to the council . 
if a state is not , the state of the port must be given more responsibility . 
eight thousand sur ninety thousand boats that are sailing the seas worldwide are below safety standards and carrying dangerous goods . four thousand 
maritime safety will , many european players is emphasised , is broadly the fact of deregulation and the practices of convenience . 
how will we be able , in the middle of the french presidency of the union &apos; s , explain to our citizens that the european parliament has taken out the necessary measures for incentives and financial deterrents who were proposed for the transition to expedite him double hulls . 
concerning the responsibilities of the port state , this cannot be underestimated by port authorities . the tasks 
i know it is the text that the council can accept , maximal but we are not going to contribute to its adoption in the hope that it will be improved at second reading . we do not , however , we recognise the against the report because shall vote the rapporteur , excellent work done by mr ortuondo , who has been taken over by a few compromise amendments to be followed with a view to showing us the way the next reading . 
we are concerned it is in the first instance of the erika , but at the same time , a tanker , sank off the turkish elsewhere , more precisely . 
i now have a few brief comments to be done about the plane yalta did . 
we have the political and economic resources to enforce and ensure respect for our choices . 
we need a complete overview of the responsibility of all players . 
this also concerns specifications double-hull ships . 
perhaps then we would have been able to avoid a disaster . 
this , i believe , is the balance can be obtained on the basis of the commission &apos;s proposals and the imo , as well as of the reports being debated today in respect of which the members who are the perpetrators really deserve our congratulations . 
the proof is that the measures being taken at intergovernmental level to improve safety and reduce pollution adventitious have had a success . 
the commitment of the classification societies must be assessed with the aid of common criteria , of accidents , with incidents : number of vessels or detentions inspected and certified , which cause pollution . on the one 
when the sank ievoli sun , the ship , in relative terms , double-hulled young man crews est community , and the flag of italy . 
but what is most important is the will which we must be guided stalwart collectively for changing the current system of rules , in maritime transport in order to push back the lack of security at sea . 
most of the amendments proposed are focused on the refusal of access to waters of the community . 
number of the candidates , or are not related to the port state control or are already covered by this directive or by another directive . 
for reasons that are similar , the commission cannot agree with the new amendment no 22 , which refers to the essential subject of the safety of navigation but does not belong in the regulations being proposed . 
i share the concerns of parliament , which underlines the fact that an owner of vessels should be able to exert any influence on society of classification . unearthly 
secondly , as part of our proposal concerning the monitoring of the erika ii , the member states will see europe navigation , even in the high seas , need to intervene in cases like this . 
mr poos , you wish to speak on the debate ? 
( parliament approved the commission proposal ) 
we withdraw our resolution because it has been reproduced in full , and in the joint resolution quasi literally the chairmen of the main political groups . per subscribed 
the beginning is rather an oral amendment , but the second part relates to a split vote that i cannot accept , because this amendment was not tabled in time . 
report ( a5-0328 / 2000 ) by mr lamassoure , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the white paper on reform of the commission ( the committee on constitutional affairs , the aspects which concern ) ( com ( 2000 ) - c5-0448 / 2000 - 2000 / 200 2218 ( cos ) ) 
watts report ( a5-0343 / 2000 ) 
the monitoring of merchant vessels must be for a service with staffed well-trained and to set up , which is indispensable , with the active participation in technological equipment in the labour movement fully of seafarers . 
i voted in favour of the report by mr watts , which is aimed at increasing the quality and the frequency of inspections at ports of member states of the european union . 
if we should have been our opinion at an earlier stage , if mr hatzidakis , in recent years had been here before , then obviously he would have proposed the double-hulled for vessels and we would have avoided it many disasters . 
the risk of shipping collisions in niger is so great that , without extra monitoring and control , the risk of accidents at sea would cease probably increase . 
you then have to stand still on the commission proposal . 
for the erika , the industries of local fisheries and aquaculture stricken especially badly hit , and it is important not only to look upon the tragic consequences in the days immediately following the disaster , but also of there look ahead and take into account the long-term detrimental effects of oil pollution . 
the baltic is an internal sea , which is already very fragile heavily contaminated by discharges industry , waste water and in agriculture . 
furthermore , the training of inspectors , in those societies varies from country to country , the other . 
but the best thing would be going to be possible for a control harmonised directly the responsibility of the authorities . turn into 
we are rejecting the generalised extension of qualified majority voting , be accompanied by an extension of codecision , parallel and bowing to the abolition of the compromise reached in luxembourg . 
upon assessment of the common foreign and security policy , we are in agreement with the who has been attributed to the treatment of supremacy to crises . 
we expressed during the whole of the intergovernmental conference , our opposition to the idea that by a majority in parliament many times now , to broaden the agenda appreciably , and we have also been reports of this position to do at all vote on the motions for resolutions presented in that connection . 
it must be made clear the importance of the social agenda if it is to be implemented expeditiously . 
as regards the general application of qualified majority voting , i do not think that i consider this to be a sensible proposal , given that she would overlap with the member states &apos; right to take a decision in due course on the communitarisation of a policy . or 
the advocates of liberal europe , not only that the misery isn broaden peoples already shackled by poverty , but they must be quite clear : on that occasion , a political project and formalise a pole of rich countries that a european market to be enlarged . control 
parliament has just voted a resolution on the nice summit with the following characteristics : 
our debates , in this house , are more à monologues successive to tell them in real trade . 
i am opposed to the development of a common defence policy and the installation of a council of ministers for defence . 
we think that this transformation of the delegations of the commission by delegations of the european community would be at risk of conflicts of interest with the lead to national diplomatic delegations in our various countries . 
it is therefore clear that it is through the road to a quest for harmonisation , when it is desired , timely and efficient , about the decisions that remain between fundamentally according participants exclusive preserve of national and at which we may want to lend more weight to the action of european diplomacy , and not through the medium to structural constraints , utterly ineffective . 
the danish liberal party &apos; s five members of the european parliament have today voted in favour of the lalumière report on a common policy on security and defence , because we are in favour of strengthening its capacity for action of member states of the european union and , at the same time , to that of nato . 
we protest against this policy which is all the imperialist military that there is a consensus in this hemicycle of water and a theme , arrangements acceptable to this policy on the part of the support expressed enormous majority of the groups , the extreme right to the greens and to the pse . 
paragraph 49 is planning to oblige member states which do not want to or are not allowed to participate in a mission , to hand and to finance it . nevertheless y take 
the rapporteur lists many reasons for one intervention outside the area , one of these is the indignation justified ethnic outside on conflicts union . 
furthermore , we have objections on many of the specific paragraphs , such as : 
such a breach with nato that are simply to fall into further close europe is making itself is far from the grand speeches which have been following the fall of the wall . 
i refuse , however , the interpreter of my vote to be the proof that i am opposed to the participation of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts . 
: the only positive aspects of this report are all well and you are asking for a &apos; european definition of the work &apos; and a &quot; domestic limitation clear d the maximum number of hours worked . 
this is obviously an ideal situation , when i read of virtually all the proposals in favour of the exceptions for itself which are listed in this report . 
tax revenue , the tax wedge vat bring price hourly levels that practically none household with centuries-old income is only prepared to pay . normal 
. ( nl ) on the work of women has a long history of the payments , poor working conditions , bad and intimidation of position unfavourable legal grounds of sex . 
its resignation putrefied conclusion of a long , must not , however , make us forget that the &quot; commission &quot; delors heaviest of responsibilities than the one that i had question him yalta did . 
but above all i have voted in favour because i would like to - and i want to say before this house - that the accounts , meaning we verifies how the money has been spent by the commission , without dealing control figures – four plus four , eight equalled eight longer eight equalled sixteen sixteen longer sixteen equalled 32 thirty-two longer thirty-two control - but equalled 64 also whether this expenditure truly were useful in the europe , whether they have really achieved the objectives that they seeking to achieve . 
similarly , the lack of transparency and measures of convenience must disappear in matters of recruitment , particularly in relation to the spending temporary . 
. british conservative meps will vote against the report because of their repeated time and again to the extension of the opposition of qualified majority voting and to the proposal to incorporate fundamental rights in the document on the treaty . 
adjournment of the session 
so i had been said , but i am going to go to new , and i will pass us longer fresh your message . 
this is the position adopted by our group . 
madam president , the nice summit is especially important . 
as regards the considerations on the substance , let me give just one example . 
we believe that this report should be more detailed and , consequently , call upon to debate and put it to the vote in january . 
yet , its presence is very important for this report , which is of great interest and of which the success tropospheric depends to a major part of the commission . 
parliament &apos;s rules of procedure stipulates that it is forbidden to smoke in certain places , amongst which the house today ; 
adjustments of the draft directive are needed , they are now presented . 
let us hope that we are able to do so from now on . 
if this is not the case , the responsibilities can at least clear and well defined . 
but , ladies and gentlemen , if you genuinely aware of the problem of the tobacco harvest .net health-related linked ban ecstasy , as you please continue to maintain what is happening in other substances that are much less quantitatively fatal . and yet 
also , amendment no 2 on carbon monoxide is particularly important . 
history teaches us that it is dangerous to assume the goal to be achieved - which is so that he can stand and whether noble virtuous - exceeds the rules . 
mr president , i want to serve the workers in this sector . 
and , although i was not here , it is clear that my vote was along those lines . 
consequently , my concern , at the present time , is not so much on the problems of health which are , of course , considerable and such important and would involve our acceptance of this restriction qu extremely restrictive interpretation of the legislative power from the european parliament . 
mr president , if it is truly a law on the close of the second reading , it will lead to a restriction on freedom of the industry on the one hand and greater protection of public health . 
the results of research in this area are so clear that we cannot , as european legislators , do not keep up with these councils . 
because of the decision of the court of justice , the council adopted a further attempt this time by a large majority . this position - and 
we would also have had to put an end to this situation . 
the power of the big tobacco industry is all too evident . 
yet , and this is a disgrace to the european union , we call on the culture of our taxpayers to subsidise this dismal substance more than eur one billion to the tune of a year . 
the procedure of the tests is ineffective . 
this directive was introduced in order to take account of the report &apos;s conclusions of the european parliament , from 1997 lópez containing many elements which we find in the already have before us and a commission proposal . there were calls to 
that is why the need to regulate - in the interest of consumers – is clear . 
in this connection , let me say as with regard to the international and community regulations , there is no exception for trademarks in measures being taken to protecting public health , and more particularly here , where the effects on the behaviour of all smokers are so considerable . 
this relates to the issue of access to goods , particularly when distributors darwin at locations of surveillance . sans 
summer time 
we also face other problems that we would like to analyse , such as that of energy consumption , the health and safety , in that their report to the idea of summer time ; but the argument which the strongest is still no doubt that we want to give the opportunity for the new member states to comply with our provisions . 
. ( de ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i note once again that the advantages and disadvantages of summertime are giving rise to discussions in greater depth . 
our group believes that the proposal which has just been made is a good one , so it takes the view in favour and that new amendments are not necessary . 
another problem , there is , as in the autumn , during the world of agriculture , it specifically states that the institution that should have disappeared . humidity morning surprisingly , the natural world is not suited to the directive . 
as regards the amendments which have been tabled , the commission has agreed with amendments nos 3 and 4 , whose aim is to make the system more transparent and to point out that the principle of precaution . 
according to the european parliament , the compromises on which we agreed the common position of the council . a considerable improvement in 
children should be given of the medicines that have only been tested on adults , which means that the children are badly treated . 
it can help improve clinical research in europe and therefore the welfare of the millions of patients . 
this compromise , which can , quite obviously , by each member state still to be surpassed lays down a minimum threshold , which is aimed at preventing the appearance in the european union to be of a kind of dumping , to a member state , who would allow ethical but not to others , of carrying out research on persons incapable of giving their informed consent . 
finally , and in this connection i should like to express my disappointment that this provision was not from this council compromise in the proposals for a withholding tax in my opinion , the conduct of the s office for the single biggest 
the next item is the report ( a5-0377 / 2000 ) by mr trakatellis , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a decision of the european parliament and council action programmes community certain extending the public health decisions / 96 / ec , adopted by the 645 candidates 646 / 96 / ec , 647 / 96 / ec , 97 / ec , 102 / 97 / ec , and / 1400 dimitrakopoulos and 1999 / ec ( com ( 2000 ) and amending those decisions / 2000 - 2000 / 0448 - 0192 ( cod ) ) . 
perhaps , i would add , do we have opened a new method of operation in the field of codecision . 
it is also a problem about which we believe that the weakness of the orientation of the european union , the council and the commission which , together with budgetary cuts , so as not to achieve the maximum of 1.27 % currently in force , the standards can be put in one fact that action such as this is coordination between the various member states whereas permitted transpires increasingly important . 
this is an area which can be taken into account in the context of the new community programme for public health which is due to begin shortly . 
the text we are adopting today on the extension to six of public health programmes in the agreements between the institutions . informal regular reflects 
all these factors , operating independently or joined-up multiplies their effect , those things which mean that each day , naturally , the millions of people cross the borders of their country of residence and move towards countries of the european union , for living , working , studying or merely y travel . 
the european union cannot accept that they receive different treatment depending on the member states in which they have been victims of the offence or according to nationality . 
we should therefore ask ourselves whether there are good reasons to approve this draft . 
since we cannot seriously speak of a europe of citizens in isolation from the rights of victims . 
the liberal group feels that a very good report has come of those negotiations in committee . the committee amendments will be voting for the start of voting time . 
compensation for victims must come first on the payment of fines and excessive costs , of justice on the state . 
i welcome the proposal from portugal to improve the basis of the victims in the criminal proceedings , even though i have every respect for the viewpoints that have been legal considerations that were made by mr lehne . 
who else would want to participate , in particular by the vote , for a democracy that would leave aside the problems ? 
several amendments refer to the official languages of the european union , providing for the right for the victims to communicate in this context , one of these languages . 
as i said before , the commission , following up its communication on 14 the july 1999 , is working on the adoption of specific measures to assist the victims , particularly through the support it on to the european forum of care services envisaged for the victims . 
we take note of it . 
i believe that the institutions , and in this case the commission , should work with more serious approach to this house in order for the proposals will in time and for the operation to appoint a rapporteur , will deal with the commission &apos;s proposal to table the amendments , in committee , and then we can reach debating debating in plenary . we are being requested to do this in plenary , which is not possible . one single 
there was no very outset of the budgetary objectives to which we have subjected our policy . 
what has most constantly tormented for was during the entire budget procedure to be financing of our external action . 
to what is happening in the case or what i as rapporteur for parliament in general will take over from the council presidency , which will return to belgium in the second half of next year and wish , already a great deal of sympathy that during the negotiations . 
i would also like to state clearly that we have in this parliament a number of vacancies who year-on-year makes savings euro million euros , so we must ask ourselves if we establish our own budget properly . made still 
another reason for dealing with this topic may be the attitude of some members on its knees of the house , who seem to know that the decisions of the council . obey blindly 
the first point of agreement between the council and parliament concerns the external action , that is , expenditure heading iv in the budget , for which our institutions . in other words a common goal shared substantial funding for a really free up , given the development of the balkans in 2001 regions of the political situation in serbia , and recent this without that the other priorities for the external actions of the geographical union of ours should have to pay their costs . 
finally , an agreement was reached on 23 november on the appropriations for payments is a growing trend of the budget for 2001 , which is restricted to 3.5 % over the budget 2000 . 
similarly , it is in a manner consistent with this interinstitutional agreement that the council has left substantial margins under the ceilings of the financial perspective established in 1999 , in particular for categories 3 , internal policies – and on heading 4 - external actions . 
i hope can also act quickly . 
the court of auditors has also recently confirmed in a special report , however , that the commission has been reached this target , that the resources of the cohesion fund are being properly used . 
as regards the individual cases of application that we have seen during the past two years , i.e. kosovo or serbia , the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in enabling us to fund more exceptional . by an exceptional effort spends 
whereas the us companies perceive three times as much aid and that a country like turkey , of course , more than 10 % of the state budget devotes to agriculture and horticulture in mind , this means that europe wants to achieve everything sans nothing pay . 
the emphasis is on what goes out on european , rather , that goes in . 
the fish , commissioner , is a fundamental part of any healthy diet , balanced and which is rich in protein . 
we believe it is absolutely essential that we think this report seeks to restore the confidence of our citizens on the progress that has been in the functioning of the european union institutions . 
after a long period of conflict and war , during which our continent has acted in one way , it is important that the very resolute balkan people if it goes into this : should know , they can also bring about , the reconstruction to count on us . 
it will damage the interinstitutional agreement . let me tell you that next year , we shall examine it in detail if we can still accept that . 
with the commitment of the standing of the flexibility reserve is transparency of the budget which is suffering in the long term , a thing , and this will lead to a loss of credibility . 
i stand here before you , who represent the peoples of europe , to present the results of the intergovernmental conference , first of all , i would on the reforms of the institutions . 
the number of areas in which the vote will be carried out by qualified majority , was , i know , that is seen by the parliament as a priority of these negotiations . 
i note also that this igc has been confirmed as a development of the powers and scope of the european parliament . 
the last six months , it is also on the path of growth and jobs that europe has progressed . 
two months ago , the ministers for education adopted an action plan for mobility , a plan for measures - and we have agreed to 42 of eur 400 million for an allocation substantial the programme which is so important for media plus cinema and audiovisual , european , and that , as you know , the whole profession expectations 
it is now up to the swedish presidency - for which i would remind you that the environment is one of the priorities too - to carry through the second package of proposals , which includes the creation of a european maritime safety agency . notably 
ec military arm , the european union will give it greater leverage in complete harmony with the machinery to nato and , if appropriate , with the support of all those member states . 
france has paid particular attention . y 
furthermore , in your speech at the beginning of the summit , you said that this house the continued success of nice not only quantitatively deems but also in terms of quality . 
in reply to this desire of citizens , we asked for the double majority , which is the only instrument that is understandable , and objective , widely shared by the smaller and larger member states . 
madam president , mr president-in-office of the european council , president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , the summit has finally reached an outcome . 
how the union can take decisions of a constitutional nature , in passing sleepless nights three victims of this disaster ? 
madam president , mr president-in-office of the european council , president of the commission , let me make a small , so far , a famous french concerning doctor was called and he has formulated a method - self-persuasion autosuggestion , founded on the principle of and in eastern autosuggestion yalta did . 
that apart , what sort of crisis , not merely cruel illustration of the institutional , but for the construction of europe more deeply , affect identity faced with the challenges facing the european union is faced trojan pact ! 
modern technology is always date repel fort even tested simple one ; burden of proof , and take decisions that are lacking in content for applying or distant and present the final analysis as with a success . magnificent 
it too , are not happy with just about all the world , starting with the small countries . 
the diversities of the interests and to the council would have avoided these debates on the number of commissioners is clinging to which each state . 
thank you , mr hager is correct . 
there are grounds here to be a contradiction ... 
before the vote on amendment no 22 : 
the use on children is covered at times . we must also of revenue and researchers , amongst others , to promote themselves to the development of pharmaceutical laboratories products specifically designed for children and children in order that the doses pathologies and means are appropriate for their own systems . pharmaceutical 
in practice , the period for the summer has turned into the period of normality . 
but when i came home , in italy , mr fatuzzo the mep , said to me , mr fatuzzo , if europe wants to be tillich 
. ( de ) madam president , i wholeheartedly support this report on improving the protection of victims of crime , which once again demonstrates the eu &apos;s commitment to combating crime and in protecting our citizens . 
according to my sources , it must be brought back in russia . 
desperate results to parliament : the refusal to allow to majority broaden seriously deliberations , the denial of parliament to codecision . i say this in passing , the fixing of the composition without parliament shocking even consulted about the composition . so be 
the decisions concerning the vote in the council and the seats in parliament should have been taken , not at a casino cannes acropolis of nice , with mr chirac , in the role of leader . en 
it seems that the negotiators swedes have had more to my heart to please the bigger countries than to be fighting to maintain their own influence to bear . 
the nice treaty contains a number of important measures towards a european union as well as elitist several measures for the distance between the union of democracies and to the citizens . 
that is why , in future , to make progress on this continent , we must have a method whereby an intergovernmental conference is based on a convention , in which the members of parliament , and not , a final word . chancelleries 
that is our commitment , president prodi , commissioner barnier . 
as regards the european parliament , only the commission has stood up for the legitimacy , which i thank president prodi and commissioner barnier . unfortunately , an outcome that they were the only things that are suffering in the compromise at the end . 
&quot; no agreement is better than a bad agreement , said &quot; the french presidency with before the nice summit , and this morning , if i understood correctly , we were told &apos; better a bad agreement than none at all . &quot; 
but the omission of nice is historic because , behind the decisions , it is a lack of vision for a union consisting of 27 states . 
from the national governments , the timely plan to give to europe a constitution has now finally collapsed . the expectation that the heads of state and government considers itself the defenders of the idea of the unification of europe has failed . definitively 
the gaps old ones were not realised , and some others have been added . 
mr. president , i would first like to associate myself , i , too , in the praise you have just made to mr brok and mr tsatsos . 
i simply wanted to take up a few of the critics , or of the lessons that i have heard , in some quarters . 
i honestly believe that the system – have i not say that it is quite clear e and readable – is a balanced system . 
that is what i will note , this debate , this presidency and also of the intergovernmental conference . 
as far as the treaty of nice , there have little to say , because we have not yet the european council conclusions and , consequently , we can do nothing without the add step . shall see 
furthermore , the treaty is a mixture of positive elements in terms not adequate and satisfactory , but is concerned , however – not , i suppose , better than ‘ business as usual at least as regards the extension of qualified majority voting , the extension of the codecision procedure for the european parliament and the provisions on closer cooperation . 
there is the fact that the european parliament has no part in the context of reinforced cooperation , despite the fact that some countries - including the leaders of parties in his speech in labour party - have been promised , and these resources have warsaw no reform of the structural funds in apparently real terms before 2013 . 
mr president , mr president of the commission , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , from the winners and losers of nice , but europe , has certainly not in the ranks of the victors . nor has the democratic and transparent . 
things cannot be allowed to happen . 
the outermost regions deserve a better and the parliament will continue , with the aid with which i am sure that commissioner barnier , for us to work extra hard to give them the whole way of incorporating them in the union . 
&apos; we have managed to keep things in hand &apos; or &quot; we have succeeded in blocking decisions , in their own countries . &apos; european 
the only one which is regrettable and hopeful sign is that the european commission is clearly having confidence . was later found 
the debate is closed . 
mr. president , i would first of all that it be noted that the budget of this year is to the work of all the members of the commission had to , above all , as well of course , that the work of the president , mr wynn , who has managed its own that we have experienced various situations , wisely , including any tense situations . 
the member states , were not concerned at the time , their public and the enlargement , to spain and portugal , was of an important mobilization of resources . 
the approval of a supplementary and amending budget will therefore be essential , and so the potential for energy savings and investment is reduced to being more concerned about , if not taken a consistent line in its entirety . 
there was no more qualified majority voting in this parliament in order to return to in article 272 . 
then , when i found that there will not be a debate on the review concerning article 25 of the , i was disappointed pretty iias is weak . and the word 
however , the european parliament is unable to keep its commitments to cut back in the eyes of outsiders . 
we are using to 1.06 % of gross national product of member states , which also creates the most important one , than it has never been , and more , too , that what was discussed at an important one , just berlin less than two years . 
in the field of environment policy , we cannot go into the establishment of small , applied to specific measures may be as helpful spaces limited , but also on the funding these births , permanent and of institutions whose work does not work with , such as is the case , for example , a particularly noteworthy , in my opinion , to the european environment agency in copenhagen . 
first of all , regarding the structure of the 2001 budget : it has been said that not enough . the agriculture budget has increased 
i think that this is a good thing to have been able to activate all the same the flexibility instrument and to provide the necessary aid to serbia , even though i quite agree with you that we should get round to the situation in a flexible instrument across europe , via the itinerant various countries and regions , and whenever the need arises , utilised cannot become a strategic plan . 
i expect a better debate take place on the next month when we debate an issue today and i propose to devote a wasn limited itself to this debate in the resolutions . 
several areas can be listed in applications for areas of agreement can be found , for example in the balkans , in the caucasus and central asia . 
this is a resource which passes for out of it so often these locations impressive-sounding conflicts . 
it underlines the importance of the strategy with russia and the importance of your report , mr oostlander . 
energy policy , which is related to the policy of the major powers , is an important area of cooperation . one example is the issue of the transport of oil and gas are from east to west . 
a member of my party – a radical militant journalist , was murdered a few weeks ago in tbilisi , to clearly has a mandate from the russian forces . city 
it proposes , for the northern dimension , a budget heading and an overall increase in aid from defends russia . 
as from this interest , the union has developed in many fields of intervention force , both in concrete areas sa common strategy for russia and in the other documents . 
in the explanatory statement , we read , in point : &apos; whereas with belarus , russia constituting a political union , it is important for the democratic legitimacy of russia , that president putin and the russian government to the absolute need to make clear and determined condemnation of reform and progress of democracy in belarus , in view of the report that was submitted in minsk on notably 16 october 2000 , with the parliamentary troika of the european union is concerned , the council of europe and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) . 
the widespread &apos; nordic dimension is receiving from this proposal , something that is an appropriation own budget is one point , very important indeed . as for myself , i propose that the energy issues are to become the driving force of this important project . 
other issues where we are seeking to support the efforts of the european union &apos;s cooperation with regard to russia , are all well and the rule of law and the consolidation of democracy , civil society , the regional and cross-border cooperation twinning , and , above all , the initiative , which many have talked about . 
briefly , about kaliningrad . the partnership agreement and cooperation gives a framework which is already on our dialogue with russia on an institutional or commerce , on visas and border upon the eu . problems 
by applying of requirements which are more favourable in the field of visas for the inhabitants of secessionist regions or in full , by exempting them from that would support the legitimacy of a full-scale start their diet . 
the question was : there have been cases where this directive has not been followed up . if you have been bandied about in our countryside . gmos 
i fear that we adopt it at that in a substantive debate that we have no time to deal with here . 
the council remains deeply concerned about the situation in chechnya , the violence continues , the humanitarian situation is still very worrying in the entry of the winter . 
the french presidency can she take over from mr nielson , calling for it to contact thors was with some haste at short notice and to see and visit chechnya ? 
one i have given is not , because you can see that the chamber is full . far from being 
mr president , i believe that the question is sufficiently precise . 
you are right , the fight against fraud is never sufficiently developed . 
nevertheless , i think the proposal presented by the french presidency is totally unacceptable , and that it did in fact only one aim : to maintain the asylum seekers outside of the eu , which in practice , could be illegal immigration properly . in turn increase 
last month , when i asked a supplementary question during question time . this fact president-in-office advocated saying not dodged simply stress that my previous answer &apos; and he then , his response . re-read 
i can assure the members who have helped me so that the council will take account of their interviewed observations . 
the council , by the whole of these decisions , to restore the confidence of consumers in the eu . hears 
you know , we act , at any given time in the state of our knowledge and therefore i cannot completely at the analysis . commissioned irate 
these are the initiatives that the council has taken or intends to take to flow towards the algerian authorities . 
with regard to your second question , the council fully shares the point of view of the un secretary-general , the aim of which is the involvement , in this exercise , in all the institutions concerned , and also of the experts , research or academic institutions organisms interested up on the issue of children . 
the presidency is very pleased with this outcome , which marks a milestone in the implementation of the pre-accession strategy defined in helsinki . the last year turkish 
the guarantees which the author of this question refers are variously on the right of every accused to defend themselves , or having himself the assistance of a defender of his choice and , if it does not have the means to pay a , to be able to be treated as a defender of lawyers , gratuitously when the interests of the policies ; they come from all insist justice if we are not understanding an interpreter , free access to or does not speak the language in beginning the hearing to be considered within a reasonable period of time , european free alliance ; or the proceedings . liberated be during 
thus , as claimed by the council in a previous reply , the programme of mutual recognition must be nothing less than make improvements in the field of fundamental rights . 
the decision to launch a operation would take the form of a joint action . in principle 
the honourable member &apos;s question concerns the opinions expressed informally by the president of the commission . 
mr president , it is with real satisfaction that i am presenting today , at the plenary of the european parliament a report on the stabilisation and association of croatia , with the european union . 
the european union has just made on at the zagreb summit on 24 november . 
i do not think that we are to develop relationships with the fact 
this issue must be subject to other conditions , namely that access to asylum on the international standards and croatia must fulfil legal be functioning in humane conditions . 
there is , unfortunately , were also reflected in such a grievous outbursts recapture yalta did . 
we hope to move forward at a great step in the context of these negotiations , and be able to do so speedily . 
i know that the croatian government is keen that the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process are judged on an individual basis , depending on their own merits . 
certainly , in many respects , the hardest remains to be done , but i do not doubt for a moment on the capacity of the inhabitants of that country to meet the challenge , to tread the path to reforms , how much there is a difficult one open to them and that leads to europe . 
the problem that the government is faced in the regions that is becoming very manifest and under this regime , were used , like suharto lands in tackling the problem of migration of overpopulation and exploited as if they were for territory captured by the adfl . 
the eu should do likewise . 
( pt ) our are very worried and are awaiting a response from the european commission to these developments . 
but the level of the cooperation should take into account the actual progress in the country of solving the problems that has been made , respecting the rights of regional and the methods being developed and also the cooperation that the man or the country is to a positive development of the process of independence of east timor , particularly not in terms of the regulation of the problems faced by the status of refugees from west timor , deeming the militias and condemning those members who are guilty of criminal conduct , and which have three officials of the united nations . assassinated recently 
the revolution in the country and the way in which it found itself , still remain the bedrock of guarded optimism . 
admittedly , the military have less influence , but they do they are always much too much . 
mrs maij-weggen has drafted an excellent report , and i will conclude by saying that europe should do , therefore , like everything in its power to support the country on the road to democracy , but it is up to the that he could abolish the indonesians themselves comes back from the policies of suharto . after-effects 
it mentions , in effect , very frankly , by name of the forces opposed to the essentials and demanding processes of reform . 
any external action handing a support for democratisation and the rule of law can only be seen as counterproductive and for all parties . inflammatory 
it goes without saying that , since then , did not end les do throughout indonesia . 
only two years ago , then it was still being ruled by an authoritarian leader supported by the army . 
the debate is closed . 
the principles it has for us , in part , outdated and no change to the situation . 
nevertheless , there are differing views on how this can be guaranteed . protection 
mr president , i can be brief because this is not the first discussion on this topic . 
we do not believe that increased solutions at community level can improve the fight against crime in that our efforts will be characterised by one , of tolerance and indifference as much of an overall eu that the administration of secrecy yalta did . 
in my view , the european public prosecutor is merely a first step along the path to corpus juris , a body of law in favour of the whole continent . customary 
we are wasting enormous sums of money which is quite simply because they are not perceived by the member states . 
you know , the commission would have preferred that olaf be created as a government totally independent . 
we must not forget that this is the unwillingness of parliament to grant a mandate for the way that taxpayers &apos; money had been spent , in 1996 , which triggered the fall of the commission in 1999 . 
we depend upon the court of auditors which provides us with the weapons with which the zones of darkness . shooting 
( fr ) we doing our utmost to monitor the commission and member states properly and report is an effort in this direction . 
mr president , i wish to begin by welcoming the opportunity of his initiative and the speed with which our rapporteur mrs eluned morgan has carried it out . 
we must be able to judge whether the situation is improving or growing worse . 
indeed , the commission of information and failed to answer retains always certain issues , notably as regards the fléchard case . 
i am sure the house would wish her all hoping and praying success in this task , although i am rather afraid that , ‘ ’ and ‘ &quot; discharge procedure are among the first few words which baby . issue an opinion 
i shall respond also to mrs stauner , who has raised some of the specific questions that this agreement provides that the requests of confidential information or to the commission will be made by the president of the commission transmitted parliamentary . 
once again , congratulations on your report . 
down in a directive than the shareholders should be given a fair price except to say that a fact , that as much of an apple when it is has been shown by the tree . mature graves 
for this reason i can only invite the house to approve the compromise amendments tabled by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
to be effective , a useful , in the public interest , such a directive must avoid a situation . first , the continued direct involvement of the courts in him preferring a regulatory body endowed with the rule of law , which has large discretion beneath ; second , to have rules in the field of jurisdiction and clarify , for that would use them ; and thirdly , an explanation of what we should interpret the fair price and to set thresholds . fourthly , ensure that the delivery of proper management wrongly shareholders from vetoing to take the decisions that they take on the future in the totipotent society in which they participate . clutching 
it is true that the regulation of the european parliament does not offer this possibility , by turning those discussions will be a mere , pure deaf ears . 
thirdly , clarification is particularly obvious : the lack of clarity in the debate on the external side , in which i have some experience . field 
the european institutions openly disregarded of redundancies and closures of companies caused by almost all of the takeovers or mergers of undertakings . 
furthermore , if we open the door on defensive measures , we shall make the restructuring of the european markets , perhaps more difficult and in particular the protection of small shareholders . 
neither the community law or the national legislation of several member states have at the moment , a compulsory system in the field of undertakings . takeover 
mr president , i would like to thank parliament for the attention it devotes to the proposal , together with the committee on legal affairs , in particular the rapporteur - , for the work they have - as mr lehne has been a support . 
indeed the first concerns only the owners and the latter only concerns the supervisory authority . 
the third part is not acceptable for the reasons which are valid for all the amendments in terms of society &apos; . what are known as ‘ 
this situation is unacceptable in the european market , given that it is incompatible with the requirements of the internal market . 
there has been some misunderstanding on the basis , because we believe that the use of corporations collective management , as is the case will be compulsory in austria . currently 
the socialist group has thus been that parliament does not of the proposals that , by accepting bringing discredit upon itself to the votes that took place in the 
the opinions on the resale right ne no border in the political groups they are drawing from the member states . but in 
( fr ) it is against the artist of resale rights . 
whatever the case , in the name of what should we impose a tax on the resale of the table , and does not do the same , with the benefit of the manufacturer or the structure of the , for a car or a tailor toeing at second hand ? sold 
for these same reasons . amendment no 4 and the part of amendment no 7 which is linked to this question should also be rejected . 
discussions about a very important subject at a time when we do not yet have in our own mother tongue of the amendments tabled at the last minute , and of the amendments before the committee that i think is quite impossible . 
this should therefore be an exception , if we hold a debate without a copy of the amendments . 
we have agreed within the commission for keeping up the question of special services , there is directive 67 / such qu enshrined of april 1997 . 
. ( de ) madam president , i could also make a lot of things , but i will now confine myself to saying that there have been such a political consensus between the various committees of this parliament called upon to give their opinion on a problem . 
of this is our responsibility . 
however , my group shares the view that we must see at the same time , as a community and , naturally enough , as member states to define a framework for a universal service . 
all of this . nevertheless , it should accede to the commission &apos;s proposals without even having been able to consult with the studies . 
we are proud to represent the citizens of europe . much of him 
( fr ) we the step to the monopolies . 
furthermore , there is reference to the 1997 directive . 
i shall be very clear on one particular point . 
whereas the communication , email , electronics , such that the former monopolies takes its source , which is focused on the inside . remain principally vis-à-vis state 
there is a link between all these things . 
i support the limit set at 150 grams for reasons of caution . 
i am not an adversary a priori of the market or liberalisation . but this request , to wit , carry out a correct manner , analysis and considering , not by a qualified precipitate all the consequences , was not satisfied that have to be created , and that is why the compromise now before us is something that i see as acceptable . 
fortunately we have of a directive which demands the subject of transparency on the part of public enterprises and i can assure you that the subsidies will be examined carefully . thugs 
i think that you have understood nothing , and it does not look as if you listened to the arguments that have been tabled . vous 
users will be the losers , together with the employees , and the competitiveness and growth european ones . 
the liberalisation being proposed will not go without causing major consequences at the services provided in the countryside , on the workers of the sector and on the postal service . users dailies 
it is regrettable that the commission has , according for headlong sheer preferred to a proposal which does not take into account the views of certain interest groups in the population . 
this sector is suffering from fierce competition of these new technologies . 
invoking the realism and to find out what the broad left up to try to find a compromise solution with a part of the right is one way of his or her own capitulation before private interests . disguising 
this figure is largely sufficient to support the public service tasks , such as a provision of universal service which is adequate and uniformity in fares . 
i have nothing to learn from the labour party about the matter of the rural areas . 
mr president , allow me to congratulate the rapporteur , mr ferber , who has not had an easy task , it is the least we can say . 
this is a decision which you are . 
mr president , in view of the discussions that preceded him , the commission is aware of how important this subject in the eyes of parliament ; i have , in fact with great attention the many amendments examined draft directive . tabled concerning the 
in short , this will be good enough and the power to arrive on time and to halt the momentum for change if necessary , a fact it represents a serious threat and dangerous for the adjustments that are under way in the long term . the employment 
first of all the blame lies for posts , which noted that our british , mr john roberts competition results in the standards of quality and efficiency as well as a reduction in prices . 
a monopoly on postal services is in danger of these and to lead to losses grind volume who , in turn , will lead to a drop in employment . 
we must nurture the momentum of change in progress , the first stage of the process and launch concretely fix a timetable of reforms to come . 
i note that the postal services can only be helped to heat up the atmosphere in the chamber and i am pleased to say . 
the report proposes , amongst other countries , moving on to the refusal of the tariff only , a tariff preference for the acp that eur 300 – a minimum , an evaluation and a possible revision the strand of the com . in-house 
otherwise , our position remains therefore of the same : scheme période for at least ten years in order to guarantee legal certainty for manufacturers and operators &apos; . that revision of these ten years , to the end not a case of moving on to &apos; tariff only tariff preference of 300 eur wuori acp countries . we require guarantees , should the system of management of quotas &apos; first come , which was the first served &apos; set up by the commission would be , for it will have serious repercussions on the acp producers , unable to be taken today has a place in the race and gloom about to open . boats 
mr schwaiger has said to you , in the previous debate , you had to combine the different views in relation to the information here complementing more advantage of problem . 
the implementation of the compromise made , and that is in line with the wto rules , must be analysed by the european commission in a report that parliament will have to study at a reasonable period of the conclusions of the report and its function ; in it will take the necessary steps , analysis , about proposing as the rapporteur stresses in his work . 
mr president , for the facilitators perplexed like me , we move from the support of at in this matter . from this surrealism bizarre 
the powerful forces resist that . 
but i think we can foresee some adverse effects on the smaller operators and on the producers of the acp countries . commercial 
mr. president , i would like to stress , firstly the effort of the european parliament , which is trying to achieve a balanced solution of those interests that i was on the complicated weave surround the com . 
the conflict with the wto has led to in the form of trade sanctions and it is not easy to explain this to the exporters in the member states affected totally in sectors that are totally unrelated . arbitrary 
the important thing is to save time in the final straight , and i propose to vote in favour of the report by mr dary . 
mr president , once again , our chamber will give its opinion on the banana issue , and i congratulate on the remarkable work he has done . michel dary 
we want to strengthen our cooperation with the republic of korea , and today we have an excellent opportunity to discuss the latest events in the korean peninsula . 
( parliament approved the commission proposal ) 
– mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to confirm the commission &apos;s position as regards the amendments adopted by our colleague bolkestein . last night 
( the president declared the common position approved as amended ) 
then it is of the citizens of serb origin croats hotbeds &quot; &apos; . 
( parliament accepted the oral amendment ) 
i would like to support the important decision in the european parliament to vote for the warnings on cigarette packets . introduction graphs ) this is a step forward for public health because we will gigantic labels and images now those who on cigarette packets it costs reflect genuinely smoking . 
the court of justice of the european community has also been proved right . 
this measure will not deliver à smoke cigarettes but less harmful than the export of jobs . 
there they have misled people for far too long . 
it is a matter of important programmes aimed at improving public health , the fight against cancer , the prevention of aids , the fight against drug addiction , the control and never the pollution-related diseases . sanitary 
i do not see why you cannot also entrust the management of its own to the public social security . 
so , i believe we must concern ourselves with all speed , as well – we hope - of the artists . pensionable 
i therefore believe that this directive will result in the international market art displace outside the confines of europe . 
but an announcement of good intentions on the stability , the rule of law , the fight against corruption , the oostlander report is really nothing more than a vote of confidence in mr putin . 
maij-weggen report ( a5-0323 / 2000 ) 
and , if we add to the corruption of european civil servants the bribing of officials of the national , public bodies the fraud . &apos; are increasing 
the institution of this new authority must not end up in a flight of sovereignty in the field which matters most . 
i would like to apologise to parliament . 
i have received many letters which testify that he is an issue on our minds . 
the whole thing must be in balance . 
but the commission can , of course , provide that information on the basis of information to parliament annually at its disposal . 
with regard to amendments nos 19 and 32 , relating to bananas , i would again bio- point out that there are already horizontal measures in securing the equivalence of bananas from third countries and of those which bio- are produced in the community . 
relations will be longer , the greater will be the world and our population . safe 
there are differences in our approaches to these questions , but i hope that this summit will send a positive message about the necessity to continue our efforts , notably by introducing totality aware like that of the access to affordable medicines , with a tiered pricing yalta did . 
from kosovo in belfast , millions of european citizens have , and i know that we do not then be grateful to it this parliament will join me in paying tribute to him today . 
i think that an important point . you mentioned it at that 
was wondering lesotho : what has given to the liberalisation undertaken by the wto ? lesotho 
i believe that the dialogue that exists between the european union and the united states should be used to achieve this objective . lastly 
i am interested in what has been said by mrs lucas on the issue of world trade and the importance of trying to ensure that a more and more free trade in the interests of poor people we have set up a landmark , as much a matter for those who easy . 
the subject is closed . 
i stress this point , because some amendments vat null for services that want to establish who , in my opinion , does not represent an essential character or socially . 
this solution , in my view , resolves the problem of discrimination . it responds to the objective of simplification . 
mr. president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the commission and parliament have made efforts in the last few years to harmonize the collection of value added tax within the european union . 
the committee on industry has developed a number of proposals in three . 39 votes against 
there exists in this proposal of the underlying assumptions concerning the place of taxation that could cause problems in the future in an international context . 
so many good reasons to observe carefully whether external costs and the air transport does not give its pays in unfair competition for buses and trains . 
when this is going on between the member states of the european union , then the vat is perceived . 
it is very regrettable that there is still at present no framework directive on the taxation of energy production . 
the liberals agree with , then , are the ambitions of the commission , but we were extremely difficult to understand the specific proposals now before us . 
i believe it is important to be found of criteria that also be doing ! 
mr. president , ladies and gentlemen , the european commission proposal which is aimed at subjecting the purchase of goods , of vat by the consumers directly digital network since the residents in the union by companies from third countries , is a major blow to the development of the business . 
so , as far as the commission &apos;s proposal to extend the time scale of the reform , i am not able to express that my neutrality . 
i am opposed to the wish for harmonisation of vat by mrs torres marques , in particular i would like to refer to the report by mr but ec garcía-margallo on e-commerce . 
all states at least 30 redistribute , often over eur 40 and 50 % of their sometimes wealth created in the year . nationale 
what is needed is the sort of minimum rates , a maximum rate , but it is necessary to give member states a margin of the policies which enable them to be clean and microeconomic 
personally , i have tabled an amendment on harmonising vat rates which aim at correcting the effects of unfair competition for that , in the field of vat rates and the operators of third countries have , at the time that they register , a huge , given the choice made the registration and 25 % from 3.00 major disparities , whereas the community do not have the choice . 
if we unilaterally tax aviation fuel in europe , the european companies really should have a lot of trouble to stay in the face with the companies from outside europe to its competitive yalta did . 
this is not the way that we have to organise their society and that is why i believe that this is an extremely good . proposal 
not only the aircraft rates would increase dramatically – perhaps by 80 pounds a ticket , thereby threatening the very existence of the most - but these small damages and more industrial aerospace would involve , tourism , trade and , obviously , the carriers cargo today an thirds carrying merchandise by air . the total global 
i agree with mr skinner , that the proposals made by the rapporteur , mr garcía-margallo y marfil , which relate to the vat applied to e-commerce , are good . 
i would like to comment just on the taxation of fuel of aviation . 
vat the suppliers of third countries , mainly american , not only is impractical , but in the case of books , newspapers and creates the inconsistencies between sold on line and a product for sale on shop they own . this same product 
my third point concerns the eu should not establish a right and should do everything it too early in order to strengthen the power and not the benefit of the european e-business yalta did . 
the results of this consultation have been discussed within the ecofin council at the end of november . 
a whole series of detail has yet to be settled . 
it is against that background that this proposal represents an attempt to keep up the harmonisation of vat rates energy-effective in pointing to the minimum level of 15 % for the normal rate . 
however , i feel bound to recall that the community tax rules current ne taxing for flights within the community . national and 
one year after the sinking of the erika , we all have to ask ourselves whether we were able , or not , to meet the expectations of citizens . 
in case the imo will not adopt the necessary measures , the commission would submit to parliament and council a proposal on a community system for liability and compensation in cases of pollution , also thinking of the oil reserves . 
parliament has taken its decision on 30 november , and from having a good model , and we established swiftly . 
as regards the question of liability , i would just say that the existing fund is not enough to provide compensation for all the damage caused by the oil slick from the erika . 
mr ortuondo , if i may turn to your speech , which concerns article 6 , on liability for pollution , i will first of all , i would be a minor seeing what the council says , but parliament has already on a position on the subject . 
the overall objective of this legislation was to eliminate the distortions of competition , with a fair mechanism the costs of infrastructure on hauliers the passing on road and at harmonising the systems of internal market of the eu . levy 
i thought that the two would be addressed at the same time , however , it is not the procedure of this house . 
the policy with regard to imports from third countries will be reviewed in relation to that assessment . 
the role of the european union is not to finance the furtherance of hatred and to war . 
i understand you asked about the commission &apos;s participation in programmes and educational , responded to one side , commissioner . 
the possibilities of widening the relevant segment of the community budget ? 
allow me to say about the end that the centre for social and economic rights texaco la stems responsible for a large number of abortions , and of a high rate of cancer abnormally equator . 
how does it intend , as from january 2001 to ensure the survival of the rest of this sector in the face of unfair competition from south korea , is once again be demonstrated in this last report ? 
commissioner , i have felt , first and foremost , of pressure off , in some way , to see that the commission has been concerned and , possibly as part of the problem . occupied 
we believe that this could not be the case as operating aid all-out prolonging – instead , the commission must be prepared to move forward a specific instrument in the event that the actions undertaken and focused on its behalf by commissioner lamy would yield a results of the european union . the fisheries sector for the 
the increase in price that would result anti-dumping measures should enable a reinstatement of the profitability of the yalta did . coke 
this proposal , which follows on from the commitments made by the community with multiple least developed countries , is intended to encourage the inclusion of these in the world economy . 
i am sure all my fellow members of this parliament are for this . 
this is the link with the question from mrs kinnock . 
to that end , perhaps you may wish to reassure me begin by saying the impact assessment when are will be available for that we are able to cite , in order to push breaking up some of the allegations that have surrounded apocalyptic and subsequently , your proposal to provide us with some further details concerning the safeguard clause to that i think that you plan to introduce into the transitional period as well as this measure before it enters into force in permanently . 
these different instruments are also available to organisations like ecpat and partners , with whom they are cooperating in the countries concerned . 
we have had a special project for that . 
which is why the european patent office are operating in the city . 
this is used as a point of view very understandable , and that i share . 
the commission will therefore take all the measures it deems necessary . 
the commission would like to inform the honourable member for an action concerning the draft is pending thessaloniki underground railway . 
in this regard , i must also point out that , once the agreement regarding franchises known in greece , the one with which eight months for the complainant form its own judgement and submit its charges at the commission . 
the definition lawful a strike is a competence of the member state . 
i would like to thank the commissioner , which decided to respond , but i should like to point constantly observe that , at the moment , in greece , are faced with the state of the students of confusion on the one hand , which will read : the centres are included and supported by any studies , on the basis of a free directive 89 / 48 / eec , they are empowered to issue diplomas studies likely to be recognised , provided that these are the united kingdom , and on the other , completed by the greek authorities and the competent bodies are not willing to recognise diplomas awarded to complete these surveys in the uk . 
the isle of proclaim off the coast of that would allow independent kingdom shipowners in question of continuing to duty-free sales . practise 
however , i am sure i can say , on behalf of my colleague michel barnier , that the facts mentioned by the honourable member will be duly taken into account in the analysis of this proposal . 
allow me to briefly state what is the important part of my report and the point that i believe this is one for this parliament , namely the issue of language diversity . 
it is essential for us to win over the commercial providers of the gains and new potential for investment in those societies that potentials can be taken into consideration by the linguistic diversity and the exploitation of information to the public sector . 
this means that the digital content is an opportunity for all those who have not had access to school , either for the whole of their lives , either because they are disabled , and i hope that this will enhance our approach . content 
it also has to be the production of content . this means localise the adaptation of products on the basis of need linguistic and cultural area , from the preferences of the consumer . 
mr president , i should like to congratulate mrs gill on her report . 
the content providers , the sector , the people who are , in the final analysis , creative people responsible for the production of the contents and to which is also directed at the e-content programme should therefore be involved in the wuori consultation . 
before i finish , mr president , allow me to mention one final important point , a last question to the commission . 
i would like to thank parliament for its strong support for the budget of this programme . 
the debate is closed . 
the floor , mr de roo . 
a surfeit structural noise in the people concerned and the quality of life . diminishes 
the environment committee is proposing here in concrete standards for the years 2006 and 2020 . wuori 2012 
correct to do more for the popular party , such as we are , the ppe group , not to give air traffic escape the european regulations and also that of no longer wants any distinctions between military air traffic and civil . 
my group does not support the rapporteur &apos;s view on the other hand of wanting to establish not only by means of maximum levels of environmental noise directive for the airport . 
i therefore agree with the rapporteur when he proposes to avoid losing roo more time and to transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise and , as a framework directive which are mandatory . 
viewed from another group it is said to have technical problems . 
it is the member states which , in accordance with their traditions , the duration of this time at a would fix bracket entering . 
i am very surprised by one or other say that we must for subsidiary directives yalta did . 
so we need the framework directive and of a combined approach and hence i also think that many of the decisions by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy are fair and correct . 
this is not what we want . 
we will make a big step forward when we have comparable data from the noise around airports . 
the debate is closed . 
this study has never been made . 
mr president , on this late hour and with one end of a carrot in republika throat , i am thinking , now no longer having a great deal to add to my colleagues . 
these people are aware , for many years now from the way in which chemical pulp is used as , above all within bread . scheme tying 
as i have already explained in the second reading , a crisis is at the root of this amendment of directive . 
i think that parliament ’ s common position considerably improves the council and i recommend the approval of the text of common project . 
i should like to thank the european parliament for supporting the position of the european commission and for the efforts being made to meet with the concerns of the remarkable council . 
we know that the commission is preparing to present a programme of sustainable development throughout the european union which should be ready in six months . 
as a legislature , we should never seek to strengthen the opposition between urban and countryside . 
the appropriations will be mainly intended for the networks of cities organised at european level in their work in the field of development and dissemination of best practice as regards sustainable urban development . 
furthermore , in practice , it is at local level that the decisions we take in this parliament must be put into effect . 
it is my belief that this innovative approach , can constitute a model for others . 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 26 , 31 , 38 and 39 . 
indeed , even if the media is in for very long , the support the precautionary principle comes not a question of making its appearance on the legal arena organization . 
mr president , mr commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on legal affairs and the internal market has risen to the precautionary principle , a few points concerning points which are reflected in the excellent report by our colleague mrs patrie has said . 
the public no longer wants to pay the price of technological innovations which , as has been , a couple of dangerous or a great many years later , that they are hazardous to public health or the environment . useless 
i am in favour of the precautionary principle . but i now wish to make a single point of concern . 
it should be borne certain items on our minds in order to ensure the smooth functioning . 
firstly , there is no such thing as a minimum threshold , below which the precautionary principle could be accepted and therefore , not even in cases where there is weak , it can be used to the precautionary principle . 
in the amendments which i tabled , i am trying to shed more light on these points and to remove anything useless . 
it is incomprehensible that the european union remains deaf to dozens of studies by independent scientists , which indicate a risk even mobile phones to human health . 
producers and manufacturers must be able to submit the evidence of the safety of their products . 
mr. president , to all sauces , accepted for the circumstances and interests of the moment , the precautionary principle can be the best of things . as the worst 
we consider that it constitutes a general principle that should be taken into account in the fields of environmental protection , and also of human health , animal and plant yalta did . 
thank you , commissioner liikanen . 
our european community is , above all a community of values based on respect for the rule of law . 
we know that , personally , we are not important , but we believe that what unites us on and we of the importance , namely the mobilises assumes murderer eta terrorism and so our clear support to the rule of law , who is now in danger from a spanish project totalitarian secession violent . 
ladies and gentlemen , as democrats , we are , by any reckoning , campaigners for a dialogue between the various parties , because democratic democracy itself consists of a permanent dialogue . 
we are proceeding to the signing of the budget 2001 . 
( in successive votes parliament adopted both legislative resolutions ) 
( parliament gave its assent to the oral amendment ) ( parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) 
before moving on to the explanations of vote , to all those men and to those of all that i do not , i wish there were very holidays christmas . 
since its inception , the cohesion fund has had a major impact in two areas of great interest to the environment and the trans-european transport networks , the community - a good example of application : effectively in the community budget and the rate of implementation to the highest level in the entire eu budget . 
we ask that , from january , illustrates the importance to an sab interest which this house seeks to give this dossier . 
the government of luxembourg is naturally being invited to be vigilant , but also to ensure compliance with the treaties . 
this one has to suffer more radical reforms in the future , not least in order to be replaced by eu enlargement . 
mr president , i voted for this report on food additives , and particularly in favour of the ban on the use of sodium alginate in carrots . retain les 
i suggest that as it also gives a copy to malta , since the only explanation of vote that he did , i believe , is composed not we were talking about malta . when will 
if , today , i voted in favour of the ferber report on ‘ european postal services &quot; it is because i believe that in the current state of play of forces in europe and throughout the european parliament , we have achieved the maximum number of what we could to prevent the disappearance of the public postal service in europe ! 
i very much regret that parliament should have finished , in the vote , with support to a position that is very damaging to the consumer . 
i emphatically reject that allegation hypocritical . 
it is not enough to recommend the liberalisation if we do not understand the effects of our decisions . 
in sweden , this proposal has already been applied in part and we can , as of now that this has resulted in a worse position than before . 
we hope that negotiations are going to open quickly and that they will ultimately lead to an agreement compatible with the commitments we made in the context of the wto and together with the interests of our traditional suppliers . 
let things be perfectly clear : i am fully aware of the interest of this body . what i , together with others , that does not refuse &apos; global village ! 
secondly , the report deals overly negatively linguistic and cultural diversity . 
it is quite clear that europe is able to meet the challenge of the markets , with the advantages that it has from the economic and employment and of course , through its cultural wealth and to its linguistic diversity – which are on the idea of an explicit recalled minority-language – faced with the regional languages and of who is a characteristic of a large share of the 
mr president , i have asked my daughter elisabetta – which , as you are aware , you of the pensioners &apos; party in lombardy too - to give me their opinions on this council of nice : what it thinks it considered that , if i were to vote in favour . 
the latter process is now ready for accession of applicant states . 
they help people may have succeeded , at least temporarily , but at the expense of serious , namely greater drawbacks supranationalism less democracy , any increase in the decision-making process . germany 
this is a development may appear quite legitimate in the eyes of some , because it tends to put into the institutions in terms of goods vehicles respective countries ’ populations . 
so it might be useful light on the more problems in the implementation of the laws that are needed in the sectors of the environment , consumer protection and of the middle of the work , and we strongly urge the different countries , to show a sense of responsibility and to improve the efficiency of decision-making procedures within the council . 
the negotiations were difficult , but the power of the union in its determination to find solutions acceptable to was all . 
this is exacerbated by enlargement of the decisions by qualified majority , 14 , in certain circumstances , those which are still able to take decisions on behalf of the 28 or 27 - since we have in practice is eliminating the right of veto on the policies that are very important for portugal , such as those of the structural funds , or agreements on trade policy . 
we adhere to unanimity in the council and then , an inability to act . latent 
for our part , as long as europe is what it is , questions of constitutional or fundamental interest of , a scope for the member states , such as those that were discussed in , can only be dealt with in a nice , because they have a very different way , in the unanimity rule . 
this has the effect of increasing the power of large countries at the expense of small ones . 
these are not cheap decreases merely resulted from the staff and other economies but also of public policy . 
&quot; ‘ so let us go to bed , and let us have a situation arising . 
whereas the structures of cetaceans has achievement is that we find an approach to project to a scheme under principles-based this programme - what can already take issue , because a proportion of the proximity of the citizens , and visibility of the added value to european , in my opinion , has already been lost and also because the member states have not all that was created by the regional authorities - has led the innovative actions in the framework of the esf to maintain a principles-based project . 
the main thing is to determine which of them , but we must also be strong enough to admit that in the event of failure , we must not of the state and to the costs swannee , adopt a strategy that takes account of this aspect . 
tourism is a significant economic activity , even in certain peripheral regions . 
this is a good report and it is based on a good commission document . 
i agree in particular in order to say that the instruments of regional policy must be steered towards sustainable , the strengthening of economic and social cohesion , and , above all , the creation of jobs , which are economically viable and durable . skilled 
firstly , we , and those on the spot , consider that the measures have been a particularly useful for the scope for innovative dance authorities and local communities do not exactly form part of the structural funds , but that needs to be expected , in order to learn to manage small-scale projects to be playing a more effective role in the programmes in the years ahead . dominant 
in the road and we finance them are lost in european added value the direct link between the public institutions and the umbrella of the problems which are closer to the citizens . 
that is why we have chosen as strategic priorities these three priorities : the information society , technological innovation and regional identity and sustainable development . last , but also 
i understand your desire to maintain direct links between the european union and the regional and local actors . 
thank you commissioner . 
the decision of the council and commission to negotiate for four months , without subsidies , to decide and later , as from 1 may 2001 on the basis of the results obtained , with reference , which can still be , will lead to it that the extended european shipbuilding industry is hardly a contract in the first four months ne of 2001 , at least not in the sectors very disputed sites . 
on the other countries , such as japan , to suffer from it too . 
concern about the sixth framework programme for research and development , other possible . in its draft , the line that existed in &quot; marine technology &apos; vote , the fifth , today , would appear , have disappeared . 
mr president , at the end of year , have a debate on the situation in the shipbuilding sector seems to become a tradition . 
over the last few weeks , the commission has told us that the plan for funding , which is thanks to which our industry , has had to be dismantled in survives january for the sake of a supposedly enhancing its competitiveness . 
so , tomorrow , it is the state who will pay a large degree , if not all , the profits of this enterprise . 
this is because we are unable to condemn any unfair competition . 
the debates in the oecd have made progress , made rather poor progress bit , and the opportunity to conclude an agreement at international level in the industry that binding naval remote . looks as 
he invited the commission to continue monitoring the situation of the market , to keep a close the procedure , if need be , to give a tbr affair at the wto was , and to raise the question of shipyards in all international fora , relevant . 
british submarine in gibraltar 
over there , with a command absolute there they the . 
mr president , with regard to the repair of the british submarine tireless in gibraltar , it is worth pointing out what is required of the commission . 
i would like to suggest to them to support our motion for a resolution . humbly 
secondly , it must demand that are provided to the population in all the necessary information , as indicated by the euratom treaty . 
the honourable members raised a number of questions about the presence of the nuclear submarine in gibraltar , that have been announced tireless 
the british authorities who complain that there will be no transportation of radioactive waste of the member states and that they transit through maintain regular contact with the spanish authorities . 
this concerns a technical problem which needs a response a technical one . the sooner the repairs will be over , the better for everyone . 
we all support the right to self-determination . 
it is particularly significant , and that is on this point i would like to insist , in that it shows what state finds itself in that respect it is a europe united , even for genetically almost funny nationalists to swallow . 
it is scandalous that , at the moment 11 nuclear submarines of attack on the 12 simultaneous navy royal of are blocked . there are four and seven are up to the reparation are showing signs of fatigue , such as those to a standstill tillich tireless yalta did . 
the specific instance is more serious than all of this since it concerns , on the territory , and hundreds of thousands of human beings a community one , not only of course , but also to spanish , in particular all the nationalities of britain . 
i would point out , to come back to the content of the draft resolutions about the role of the commission , that the british government does not consider that the euratom treaty will be applicable in situations of this kind . servicemen 
these sentiments , pressed the debate , it is understandable , but the honourable members know that in responding on behalf of mrs wallström , i can merely as clearly as possible what is part determine who does not come within the scope and have done so community competence . 
/ 2000 by mr watson , on behalf of the eldr group , 
the suicide primarily among the young people can no longer put up with their location hopelessness 
he has participated in operations specific when the secretary-general or an authority from the un has asked it and in accordance with the countries concerned . 
we will continue to work in this spirit to work out the proposals for the instrument that will replace the dublin convention , the conditions for asylum qualifications on the basis of the geneva convention and the subsidiary forms of protection . 
the commission is also working in close cooperation with the unhcr for ensuring a smooth transition between the humanitarian and development . 
/ 2000 by mr haarder and malmström , on behalf of the eldr group , 
solana , we have been told of the above , but we were to understand too , has said , i quote , that it was difficult to deal with a regime such as yalta did . 
this of course it is this , or the amnesty . combined with a

i can assure you , ladies and gentlemen , that this is an issue which i will deal , not only in our capacities as result of this debate during my next visit to belgrade 97 after the elections on 23 december . 
/ 2000 by mr queiró , on behalf of the 
on tunisia . 
i would remind you that , at a european parliament delegation in argentina , the former president told us that the democracies ne remembers sometimes other democracies . that is to say , than do post mortem , if there is more democracy . 
mr. president , the european parliament gives to the agenda , for southern africa in particular , one of the mozambique world &apos;s poorest countries which , you will recall , has been the last year by a natural disaster ravaged immeasurable . 
we regret that the other political groups were not prepared to do it this time . 
consequently , we urge the commission to ensure a strict conditions in this country which does followup deserves to be seen to be done , of course the issue of human rights . respecting

so might mehdi in tunis , citizen , arrested on 11 august , at the airport . 
the house of publishing the premises have been closed , of which a number of months , is to publish an impromptu basis . prevented 
the motives for accusations are very vague . 
mr. president , i would firstly like to thank the solidarity expressed by others in relation to the last in the terrorist group eta . assassination 
the call for a meeting of the association council , devoted to the human rights situation in tunisia must be followed by actual effects ... 
our experience to chile in the area of democracy and human rights was , therefore , for projects in other countries . subsequent crucial

and this is not by chance that the oau and numerous african heads of state , absolutely condemn tropospheric ivoirité . 
the collapse of the price of cocoa , the crushing weight of foreign debt and the increase in fuel prices , among others , have pushed the country towards a situation marked by in-house to rising tension a major social , rising unemployment and the climate degradation poverty . 
we members of this parliament we have a duty to safeguard the rights of the people of côte d &apos;ivoire and elsewhere - to a 97 democratic system with a properly organised , fair and judiciary . 
let me be clear that the commission shares parliament &apos;s view that the process of transition from a military coup in côte d &apos;ivoire an elected government is a long way , and this is a euphemism , standards that we want to implement . seeing democratic 
as regards the references that have been spoken here , i must say that i at me uncalled wasn agis under normal not thus and i made at no stage the normal course of the debate . altering 
as you know , honourable member , i addressed this afternoon in parliament on two occasions this issue , but what i have talked about the competence of the commission , that really was no such thing as sound . 
the european parliament is not sovereign in setting the calendar . 
faced with this problem , it is necessary to show a great deal of sensitivity and to work towards the creation of an absolutely necessary for developing a set of solidarity and implementing a significant political à character holistic social security , social protection , and above all to ensure that every country has made in its the idea that the concepts cultural includes reconverting elderly are not a burden on society but that they should be seen as a resource , a human resource foremost a social resource next , and , finally , a resource even cultural property of a vast to be passed on to subsequent generations . experiment

the low level of employment of older employees is something which the european parliament should have done something long time ago . 
the shortage is even , as an argument which is used in order to boost the retirement age and throwing away the before . for the reduction removed barriers 
the oecd has already carried out some research on this issue a couple of years ago and which was published on the reports .

mr. president , the commission &apos;s communication represents , i believe , an important step in the history of the social policy . this matter is at a time when all is said for the elderly is just to the generation of those who cannot keep this as a recital or the disabled . 
given that the markets are only looking to the young people and to their purchasing power , the cases of the older people remain in the remit of the policy . 
one of our colleagues has said : it is not the who are living too long , that is not our society which is too old , but there are a few centuries people up much more quickly than the good lord dying rise was wanted , in it as part of our genes .

the problem of ageing is part of the most important objectives , which decide how to cooperate in the new process of social protection .

this approach is entirely desirable along the lines of what is already being done for the promotion of agricultural products in third countries . 
you of it could lead to a unanimous decision which , without doubt , having known the greatness of mind the commission , the to accept our amendments . the totality would lead

it is a case , of course , a great opportunity for the rural world , which precisely these show the gap separating it will plug major centres and new opportunities will also be created which , at the end of the day , worth apply certainly taken into account . 
we now hope that parliament will follow them very broadly , and naturally , i call upon my group to support you and square .

whilst not sought , it seems that i am going to be the last speaker of the year 2000 .
