this only serves to aggravate the anti-democratic nature of the european union , and i hope mr moscovici has understood that mr prodi has made , today , a real defence against the activities . in addition , i really do hope that this trend will be adjourned in reversed at the councils in nice and biarritz . 
these negotiations , we know , are very difficult , and some concern to be a failure or a minimal agreement at nice , even worse , you have already agreed , mr president-in-office . 
any other way of doing things would lead to a democratic deficit must be said . 
mr president , president prodi , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i thank the european parliament delegation to the convention and the president of this one , roman herzog , for their committed work . 
mr president , i would ask you , very seriously , to reflect on the following : if you take refuge behind the decision in cologne and don &apos;t want envisage à integration may be taken by the charter into the treaties , so much trouble it inspiring encouragement perpetrators of human rights are being benefit of our procrastination victims of this disaster ? 
but here i should like to say that if not a point of disagreement , at least of emphasis on two points . 
he was right to emphasise what has happened in the meantime the wall and the unity of germany , there are ten years . 
it has also made a suggestion , which is extremely interesting one concerning the link between the charter and the discussion about an eventual article 7 . 
this work possible , and the study by the european university institute in florence , is an excellent basis to draw it effectively . 
here , mr moscovici , i do not think one has to be at all eu agenda . 
to now it does , however , we note that president putin , has a policy of opening up towards the west . 
report ( a5-0235 / 2001 ) by mr skinner , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission communication entitled &apos; the proposals to continue to put into place risk-capital simple one ; the plan of action &apos; ( com ( 1999 ) - c5-0320 / 1999 - 1999 / 493 2208 ( cos ) ) 
is there not in here are two sets of standards ? 
recommendation for second reading by mr piecyk , viii ( a5-0232 / 2001 ) 
at the same time , the introduction of bus bigger dimensions should reduce the number of buses are added in circulation , which would fly in the least to the environment . 
we took the risk capital resources is very dangerous . 
in reality , entrepreneurs are most often to become like players who are hoping to touch the golden goose yalta did . 
she does , however , precisely on the right of ownership , on freedom of enterprise , which will hit the minority which has capital ; the right to use and to abuse it . 
mr president , i abstained from voting on the resolution on the charter of fundamental rights of the european union because i think it is this charter , remains unsatisfactory , in spite of some steps forward . 
as a member of parliament &apos;s delegation to this house , and after working with my colleagues for eight months on the subject , i must say that the charter of fundamental rights would have been able to represent , in effect , added value to europe but that , in this state of affairs , we can only be changes and of its content , neither of the working methods that have led to its preparation . 
the group the csu in the european parliament agrees with the provisions with the horizontal regulation which specifies that , no new competence wasn are created for the community and for the union . 
because we believe that the constituent process of europe deserves a genuine public and democratic debate , there cannot be a political construction of europe with no social rights or democracy . 
that concludes the vote . 
( a5-0249 / 00 ) by mr poos , on cyprus . &#91; com ( 1999 ) 502 97 c5-0025 / 2000 - 1997 / 2171 ( cos ) ) ; 
i am convinced that some countries will be able to carry out the preparations made sufficient it over that period of time . 
the french presidency will brief immediately your committee , mr brok , on the result of these negotiations as early as on tuesday afternoon , as is now the norm here among us . 
we are counting in effect , in full agreement with commissioner verheugen , the negotiations out of 42 new chapters , which means from four to nine , depending on the country , just as the portuguese presidency , before us . 
but the date of 1 january 2003 , which is the only way if the union to be agreed , as the candidates and for us , an objective very ambitious and it is with this in mind that the presidency will use all its efforts . 
i am quite happy , of course , to follow the very important debate which we are to meet here today . 
the current enlargement process , the most important in the history of european unification , is morally desirable strategically necessary and that is politically feasible . 
if we can see that those countries engaged in the process of enlargement , have already achieved in a short space of time , the stability of their democratic systems , which is one of which these people have been doing for itself . 
for the eu institutions , they must be used to monitor the success of the process and to follow the development of strategies for the negotiations . 
i will mention only agriculture , environment , regional policy , internal and legal affairs and the budget . in the form of the commission is working with a new system of preparations surveillance that will enable us to assess it , and at all times the state of negotiations and the actual implementation for each country . 
mr president , minister , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are dealing today with the brok report devoted to the progress of the process of enlarging the european union – a subject each year . 
in our view , paragraph 25 , and the amendment tabled . ( de ) my group on this issue to be essential . 
mr president , mr brok &apos;s report is an excellent description of the position of the european parliament . 
the challenge of reunification , the more than that of enlargement , is so huge that it probably pervades or surrounds all the parliamentary debates . hence the depth and strength that result from all our discussions , including this morning &apos;s debate on the need to prepare itself to this challenge , the ordinary . 
the important thing is not to leave is being played off frustration among the candidate countries who , remember , even if they are waiting for worldwide precursor , is not yet entered well into the union . 
our group considers that by acting in a determined manner , it is perfectly possible for the first group is able to join at the time of the forthcoming elections to the european parliament , but we need to act strongly made on all sides . 
the differences over what is stated in mr brok &apos;s report of details which are of the more important points . 
in all these issues , the brok report and has confined itself to say nothing to change , reforms . 
the personal involvement by the rapporteurs of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , as well as exchanges of opinion fertile qui took place there , are going unfailingly that direction . 
enlargement , i have just said , this is an historic process , this is a must . 
it is a matter of the credibility of the union . 
create the conditions for the success , because it is important that this enlargement is not a , that this enlargement is not just a outburst decision symbolic then future problems . 
none of you do so , should be surprised that those responsible for the negotiations , the prime ministers , presidents of parliament , your colleagues in the national parliaments are complaining that things are not moving fast enough . and what this is really a sport valued in europe . 
we should not set a date can awaken disillusionment fix a date which is too early , that this can result in a certain degree of complacency : this means , therefore , that we will tackle the issue of the date at the appropriate time , when we shall be a certain knowledge when a particular country sufficient ready for membership or not . 
we have it was already very broadly . 
before i come into existence , freedom and democracy had been allowed to take over on oppression and the folly of the war , and a european union had created . 
these countries are causing considerable amounts of european culture , diversity and of possibilities multiple whose the unified europe must not be without . 
if estonia knows adopt during the negotiations a course of action is effective and targeted way . she has a good chance of becoming one of the new member states of the union . 
the criticisms and proposals put forward in my report on some progress to be urgent and necessary administrative and social matters are aimed solely at licences rapidly and successfully latvia into the european union . 
it is our duty to continue to support latvia on the issue of integrating the russian population . 
the link that still exists between the motto of lithuania and the dollar is also playing a role to be so happy when litas is following the increase in the dollar against the euro . that represents a step backwards export contracts lithuania towards the euro zone . 
that is the only way to improve the possibility of development for kaliningrad , too . 
many of us believe that , in order to promote and maintain , this support , it would have been helpful to lifetimes indicate dates for accession . 
there are any particular problems facing the czech republic , in particular of the border with germany , is the problem of prostitution , particularly of child prostitution . 
we are in the middle of a process of negotiation . 
the problems that i let you have mentioned are not insurmountable . 
these policies have to lead to an equal status they were free , not forced of individuals from the community . 
the resolution and the report we are relevant to focus on some of the most controversial issues , and that is the nuclear safety , border controls , the treatment of minorities and the problem of corruption . 
perhaps now is not a coincidence that the same poll audience reveals that the ambassador to the european union is the second most popular in rumania personality today . 
mr president , commissioner , your rapporteur agrees with the opinions of the commission report on slovenia , and i can see that the criticism by 1998 have been a shock , it would encourage the authorities in slovenia , which have since come reacted by speeding up the adoption of the necessary measures for the accession . 
the continuation of the status quo , the outcome of the turkish invasion in 1974 , is unacceptable for july / august the european union . 
it was only logical that the helsinki european council in december of last year , gave the go-ahead , in the process of opening negotiations for accession , to the resumption of negotiations with malta . 
the tendency for neither this report to encourage the politicians of poland to speed up legal adaptation of the eu and to implement the acquis and the conclusion , a few days ago , the agreement on liberalising the agriculture market polish emit positive signs in this respect . 
on this point , it has the support of the commission . 
i would like to talk about some elements that are to have priority . 
that is why it is that we can continue to be honest , draw up more and more obstacles in these areas . 
fundamentally , however , we must remember one thing : the huge efforts and the absolute desire des candidate countries join the european union must be sufficient grounds for us prepare ourselves for this . 
mr president , we may have a tendency to believe that the accession of new member states assumes that these risks must be up to the higher standards in order to protect the environment and nature . 
mr president , when pandora opened sa box the evils of wuori humanity sisters were released . 
hence my report focuses a great part of its recommendations to the need to encourage the phare programme to be done more in the field of health and to encourage countries to cooperate in the course of action programmes for health issues and in other sectors . 
we must start to talk about this development européen built-in polycentric yalta did . 
we have heard something of the topic of the carrot with regard to the sector of policy and promoting regional 
there are a number of other points made by the committee on regional policy in his report . 
in order to avoid the same thing may be repeated that , it is essential to ensure that enlargement is not only beneficial to humans , but also opportunities for women . 
the fact that people should be up to more balanced , and reducing working hours is just one proof , i have told this earlier in the same terms of the colleagues in central europe – that we have moved from a honeymoon on reality normally holds . 
the outcome of the intergovernmental conference , depend on the conditions that are inevitable , so that the european union can undertake enlargement . 
the group of the greens / european free alliance calls for a conclusion of negotiations with the first group of applicant countries at the end of 2002 , so that the first accessions may take place before the next european elections in 2004 . 
the various reports are expressions of this opinion this is all about . 
scarcely emerged from your old jail no.6 , go in with a new one . 
i believe that by going already all too quickly to six , and then for 15 countries , we have demonstrated our inability to build a europe which respects the disparities in its first members . 
we will see a strengthening of competition and to speed up the process of reform , including in western europe . 
at various stages , are , however , measures were taken , during and after the second world war , is clearly not the copenhagen criteria to be given the spirit which prevailed at the time , but all in all events , it is in that law was brought into being , the structure of an ideological and political point of this period , including the peace treaties . 
for these reasons , in our own experience in greece , our opposition to the enlargement of the european union is the expression of brotherly solidarity with the benefit of workers , and in general to the peoples and countries seeking membership . 
it is imperative that the accession negotiations between romania and the european union that is exactly what the romanian government has detailing need in order to improve the standards and quality of the homes in that country . 
in the report by mr gawronski , the commission is , for example , were requested to examine the relevant measures in order to promote the development and strengthening of synergies between poland , lithuania and the region of the russian kaliningrad 
mr verheugen , as chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development , i have taken the opportunity to visit the applicant countries . 
the poos report underlines the fact that democracy , in cyprus , to function in the best , because the exercise of human rights and freedoms is the cornerstone of the tradition , social and cultural nature of the island , and that the structures on society of countries involved in such a sharp focus on the human person . 
the audiovisual sector is very important . 
mr president , today &apos;s debate relates to the major challenge for this change in the millennium : unite europe in order to set the peace and security , and foster the growth in social , economic and environmental . 
mr president , as a member of the delegation , lithuania , i would like to support the comments that mrs hoff made in his report . 
on discrimination flagrant violations in other countries such as poland and malta . 
this is a development to tighten up with greater or lesser success , but it is the bearer of great hope in that these citizens will become the day will the union &apos;s citizens and will therefore be called upon , in particular , about links with their home country of origin . 
still , therefore , to seek to replace the principle &quot; each within the framework of its findings by each within the framework of its results , however , first of all . &quot; elections 
his cooperation with the international community in the course of the conflict in kosovo and was a very balanced , at the time , are essential for the whole region . 
as one of these efforts is the privatisation and restructuring of the economy . 
persons ignorant and excluded are not permitted to join in a society of information but which are a sign of its failure . 
member states could do more in their operations to help the applicant countries to develop twin their administrative capacity . 
these parts of europe are to end there , above all to cyprus . 
enlargement is instead a concentration of economic resources , we must acknowledge this , but this combination may also be asking - in terms of economic , significant gains in the future , by increasing the breadth of the market and the growth in our continent . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the importance and scope of the historic opportunity for us to unite our continent in peace cannot be ignored . 
here , we must also add that we must be prepared to implement them at administrative level . 
as vice-chairman of our european unionczech republic joint parliamentary committee , i know that this is the case in the czech republic and i assume that the same applies to other countries . 
ten years of involvement of the united germany to the eu is that we will have the history of solidarity that must now be to share with others , even when enlargement is not just a question of solidarity . 
this tension makes the &quot; model eea &quot; reasoned because il rewards candidate the period of application . 
after the horrors of two world wars and 50 years of oppression and dictatorship , communists , in which have been trampled underfoot , in the name of the class struggle , the dignity of human rights - universal value as far as is in point – the , religious freedom and large democracy christian the environment , it is time to bring together at last of our continent and that region . 
it must be clear to all the countries that join the european union does not lead directly to the entry to economic and monetary union and access to the euro area . the time limits that are different . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , yesterday the president of the commission said in his speech that he who weakens an organ of the european union is weakening the whole of the european union . 
mr president , it was with enthusiasm , and , in my view with great interest , which we are approving today for the reports on enlargement to the candidate countries , including the czech republic to which mr jürgen schröder , has dedicated his report . 
in my opinion , and i would like to take advantage of the presence of a former attorney-general irishman say &quot; the commission has not yet shown the decisiveness required to resolve this matter . 
( a5-0257 / 2001 ) by mrs paulsen , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a european parliament and council decision on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition ( com ( 1999 ) 654 c5-0344 / 1999 - 1999 / 97 0259 ( cod ) &#93; 
this is a central and important the work of prevention . 
they cannot actually confidence if the control which is subject to very different from one member state or region to another . 
being unable , for my part , to sacrifice the food safety on the altar of profit by the agrifood lobby , i have withdrawn my name from the report . 
when it comes to establishing the maximum values , we must bear in mind that nature has its own laws , that the harvests are different and that , ultimately , the livelihoods of farmers will suffer because of environmental effects on which it ought not to have any influence . 
we addressed in the same way all the other areas relating to the prohibition of lessening its impact . 
this directive is the first link in a series of decisions relating to this issue of food safety . 
of course as zero risk is not possible . however , it is important to implement an alarm system . 
we do not dispute the paulsen report , we strongly agree with its contents . 
the commissioner should know that in my country , the consultative committee which is independent in matters relating for feed is feared that a ban of this scope should not bring about a shift of the operations of mixture outside the eu , wherever they have fewer chances of being both properly monitored and controlled . ( es ) first of a future penetration eu market . 
i am delighted that the ppe-de group has withdrawn his suggestion for amendments to the problem of lessening its impact . 
as i see it , &apos; from farm to tropospheric étal &quot; is an expression of the year in the field of consumer policy of the eu and does not suffer almost any competition . 
unfortunately , in future , of criminal acts are not going to be totally ruled out , despite our efforts . 
mr president , this directive is an element of the package coherent planned with a view to ensuring , in fact , the safety of all stages of the food chain . 
if the legislation on hygiene had shortcomings in this connection , we must look at it again . 
secondly , the commission cannot accept amendment no 27 , in which parliament is proposing to delete the possibility of laying down criteria of acceptability for resources for food of animals has been presented to some of the processes for decontamination . 
amendments nos 39 and 40 , which propose to delete the possibility to introduce limits on action , are equally unacceptable . 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 5 and 22 in the committee , on the early warning system in their current form . 
the next item is the report ( a5-0233 / 2001 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 79 / 373 / eec on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs ( com ( 1999 ) - c5-0020 / 2000 - 2000 / 744 0015 ( cod ) ) . 
commissioner byrne , we are very satisfied . 
producers have an obligation to prove the composition of compound feedingstuffs now through the provision of , if requested , detailed information in order to shift partially the burden of proof but also to play down the endeavours of control in the member states . 
the issue of grain gm settled elsewhere than here . 
the standards are as little as compared with each other and still less transferable , 
that is simple , but for ten years is about the bush flour . 
i envisage a more critical of a safeguard clause is concerned , which would open the european union rights which the commission to take its own measures , and not be able to engage in consultation with the member states . 
based on accurate data , constitutes a second step , also needed . 
thus , in the council , a majority in favour of a very important member states are not in favour of compulsory indication systematic on labels , the ministry of the precise composition of compound feedingstuffs intended for animals of the report . 
madam president , i regret to inform you and this house on a new tragedy at sea . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
the recital text in question would therefore - and i quote - &apos; to recital c ) , whereas the situation of roma receives still no attention is now more essential , given that discrimination against the roma must be taken into serious account by the hungarian government , through the adoption of a set of positive measures which could lead to an assimilation free des individuals belonging to this community , whereas it is important to find a solution by setting up an office of the minorities and to the adoption of legislation in the medium term , which will promote the integration of roma people in society as a hungarian one . &apos; 
mr president , i would just like to say that there is no longer to broadcast from recital a , but , in agreement with mr martelli &apos;s liberal socialists , there is a new article 1 . 
i voted against the brok report on the enlargement of the european union because , even if it is evidence of clear-headedness , both technically , he has demonstrated political viewpoints mistaken on the future of the european project . 
the extension of the union , at least in the first step , at over ecu 100 million new citizens , will breathe new life into the development and integration of the european economy as a whole . 
her report sets out clearly the issues and the objectives of enlargement , in the field of regional policy , and this is in terms both political and financial . 
on preparatory measures , which has lasted for long periods of time and of the transitional regulations , individual covering often many years have been necessary . 
we must provide an appropriate response to an enlargement which is going to make a substantial increase in the least-favoured parts reflect together at the risk of strengthening of the imbalances in the european area in order to prevent europe from being nothing more than a vast heterogeneous whole . 
so where are the &quot; advances &quot; for the populations who were never consulted victims of this disaster ? 
i fear that this range of reports on the country and of great reports crusades will prove to be , especially in countries counterproductive have applied for accession to the european union , particularly the countries of central and eastern europe . 
and when i see what has been achieved so far in this field at the intergovernmental conference , we cannot be particularly proud , and we must first put our own house in order , instead of demanding from the applicant countries from carrying out of the first steps that we do ourselves are unable to perform . 
that is why , along with my fellow meps from the national front , we would avoid a situation to the nations of eastern europe that the mistaken action of a &quot; disintegration &quot; in the union take yalta did . 
it is necessary to consider , now , new instruments and new forms of intervention for the benefit of all the areas in which have been informed of the deficiencies in infrastructure and networks of services , such as the south of italy . 
it would be desirable if the governments of the candidate countries are working together towards a strengthening of administrative capacity , so that the acquis communautaire can be applied in these countries even before accession . 
and more to do than to cumbersome exégèses accounts , it is this view , or the lack of it - which will have to determine our decisions on enlargement at the appropriate moment , since european construction does not make sense if it ceases to be mainly political . 
i take this opportunity to pay tribute to the pensioners and elderly people of poland , of which some , incidentally , are organised on a party of the pensioners &apos; , similar to the pensioners &apos; party i represent in the context of this european union . 
a restructuring of the agricultural sector appears to be made to prevail in a country in which the rural population represent 38 % of the population should be full and 4.9 % of gdp and where the employment in agriculture is estimated that , compared with 5 discrimination mechanisms 27.4 represent 1.05 % yalta did . 
mr president , i welcome the fact that this house has adopted , by a majority of over 90 % , the excellent report by mr schröder , which calls for the second year running , decrees run counter to international law and human rights , and stresses that they violate the acquis communautaire and the copenhagen criteria . 
as stated by mr wiersma in his report , i would stress the progress made by the slovak republic on the protection of minorities . 
van orden report ( a5-0241 / 2001 ) 
i welcome the report winterbourne sur called romania that the european union , and i agree with most of the conclusions to the rapporteur . 
quite the contrary , i cannot wait for cyprus is concerned here with us , but i cannot accept this , in particular to the ( 4 ) and even-handedness the fact that the report stresses , not at least on the need for a political solution before accession . 
as pointed observe m. soto do we not expect that we can move , and the success of the un process easier it is far from guaranteed . 
it is essential to bring projects involving the two communities and promote the dialogue between the two sides in a new spirit of trust . 
from an economic point of view , the accession of cyprus should not pose any major problems , given that the country has a market economy and to a high standard of living . 
mr president , of course , the pensioners &apos; party is particularly close to the health aspects of food and food , it was therefore appropriate that i voted in favour of report paulsen . 
these are , for example and gallons of milk infected by the dioxin crisis which may have been legally diluted in milk . 
we must continue to denounce the violations of human rights in burma . 
those of us who are sufficiently at ease and evade the possibility to shape their own working environment and social conceive inevitable that they face discrimination appalling facing some is confronted daily risking sometimes of their lives . 
what image of the world is a child who grow up in an environment which treat it differently from the other on the pretext that it is a girl or forms part of an ethnic minority , or is hamstrung or homosexual victims of this disaster ? 
at previous discussions , people from families wearisome social problems , of structures quartier or as they deal with a disability are very often are rejected . 
they are afraid of having to take on staff with the values and beliefs which time they cannot identify with . 
it wanted to go in the restaurant , but to refused the entry under the pretext that his appearance physical would drive the others . 
the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights has always tried to demonstrate that this approach gave a wrong signal , politics , as it is fragmented . if there were a hierarchy of discrimination . 
the fight against discrimination will affect us all . 
parliament is going to send , through our votes , a clear message to all our people to tell them that we want to improve the progress made by the member states as regards guarantees of equal treatment , irrespective of age , race , disability or of sexual orientation . 
if this is a sample of what awaits us in future i hope it will submit a number of others . 
i would also like to congratulate mr mann for the result of his work , which has now been tabled in this report . 
nevertheless , there is no doubt that the report presented by mr cashman , contains some good things , particularly the place which is given to ngos . 
we have also decided , rightly , gender discrimination in this directive because the latter is already the subject of an eu directive , which is individual which will be improved by the commission &apos;s proposals , based on a legal basis which is far more robust , to which the parliament has , moreover , the power of co-decision . 
society must work out in the matter of the concepts complementary for policy and practice . 
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to remind you that in europe , each time that they were forced to apply the principle of prohibition , the danger is that we then had to turn back . it happened in germany , when you want to repress parties neo-nazis yalta did . 
the italian state president spoke this morning in this house and i was interested to hear it said that this union it was not the purpose of denying the values which are national . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this week is a week of importance to the debates in this house . 
thus , for the first time , the intervention is different : there is no question of a barrage of financing , but to check the quality of interventions which we must insist . state aid must be monitored and their results subsequently yalta did . 
we therefore support amendment no 18 to the report mrs mann , which requires member states to abolish all the provisions of the penal code which qualify as discrimination against homosexuals . 
in france , many examples . 
with national law of the fifteen states have provided for as discrimination , including france , a socialist , the france of mr jospin , the socialist 
mr president , the vote on the council directive on equal treatment at work extends the prohibition on discrimination which exceeds the racial , ethnic groups and others who are used as a springboard to discrimination and to which the article 13 are talking about . 
mr president , commissioner , some of the debate shows , in fact , that we have here is in need of a directive , because if we said that europe is involved in such a way as an area that should in centralizing the substance of the member states , and bearing in mind the addressing of what happened in recent months in numerous countries in europe - just yesterday on television , there was yet again by a host of reports on attacks against synagogues jewish sur rape foreign , and so on . let us just be cheek to dare to say that europe does not have to come and directive in order to combat discrimination . 
i still have two messages . 
i therefore believe that it is necessary to involve the public and private sectors and , in this respect , i think that the public sector must take the lead . 
article 13 of the treaty of amsterdam has been a challenge to the european union . we are committing the community of the specific powers to initiate a raft of actions to fight against discrimination , so that the same level of protection is guaranteed to all the disadvantaged groups . 
we must support amendment no 37 by the committee on employment and social affairs , which provides for derogations in the field of religion or belief in the back for those entering directly into contact with members of this belief in the framework of the social security schooling , or of the health benefits , such as the salaries of teachers in the schools , doctors and nurses confessional into hospitals and work , people visiting of detainees and the advisors and auxiliaries of living for the children , the elderly , adolescents , married couples , regarding which such services desirable socially speaking are provided by human bodies , of religion . 
i congratulate the rapporteur and , in conclusion , i shall be voting for these reports , with the exception of point , which i have mentioned . 
mr president , commissioner , the task that we work to which is to convert into practical policies. the article 13 of the treaty . 
i would also like to thank the committees involved for their support and collaboration with a view to achieving a judgment coordinated a short space of time . 
there are three types of amendments . 
the commission is willing to simplify the wording of article 5 in order that this provision should be better understood . 
we all know that this is very important , but i must point out that in some member states , the collection of this kind of data is a violation of the provisions on the protection of privacy . constitutional 
i had to respond to over 50 points , and amendments that are different and , i believe that these amendments will be adopted during the french presidency . 
you cannot claim to respect democracy and human rights , provided that you don &apos;t do what is necessary to prevent the weapons of death and the suppression of falling into the wrong hands . 
it is clear that a good number of weapons are to be found in the wrong hands with the activity to arms brokers . 
in this sense , the titley report is particularly successful . it also highlights not only its merits but also all the loopholes - the limits of the report presented to us , as well as the feasibility of the code of conduct . 
we are still seeking a regulation , which is more restrictive and more urgent given the developments in the market and in the arms industry . 
mr president , despite its merits undeniable , the report is still quite technical and is taking place in a field of safety and to a model based on the armed forces , which gives a weight disproportionate to the views of the arms industry . 
on the basis of this account , i plead for a very clear : what criterion is so prevalent in the event of a contradiction between the criteria put forward by mr titley , victims of this disaster ? 
the code has already moved to the mutual understanding of the policies of member states , it has set up an efficient consultation mechanism and stimulated the dialogue about the implementation of its provisions . 
several of these projects are under way or under consideration . 
in its resolution of 18 may 2000 , parliament has provided us with a strong support to this project . the implementation of this initiative is , by now , set in motion . 
these proposals will be added to a series of communications specialize representative other contributions to the achievement of the european research area . 
this is an important role that it has to play . 
commissioner , i would like to draw your attention to a question for a very long time , all those who have been involved in research . 
there are some new formulae for . 
but in this regard , i would nevertheless like to say to parliament until it is important that this need , which has expressed and which is also the engine of economic development and innovation in this area , is taken into account at the level of the meda programmes and in all the programmes for external relations . 
and if we cannot give you , as of today , to answer is that i wanted to specifically , in this item of orientation , call upon the member states to adopt positions , because there will be no european research area that we accept that at the will of the commission . 
on the ecsc , as you know , there has been agreed , and research will continue . 
i have to be accountable , not only to the court of auditors , the taxpayers , but first of all to the european parliament , who was instructed to monitor and approve this budget , and i think that this is my job , and my duty to say , at the point that i think this is an opportune moment , what is happening and to act transparently , with respect to the budgetary authority that constitutes the european parliament . 
i believe that the decision is yours , your services are provided with the elements , but they must be able to respond . 
i believe that , of the 102 spds which need to be signed and 83 are currently under negotiation , and i am referring to his memory . 
. ( pt ) as the honourable member of your house has remarked , the excise duties applied by the uk on petrol and diesel , which are used as fuel , are the highest in europe . however , the excise duty on fuel oil and on aviation , provided they are used for industrial and commercial purposes , or also for heating , excise , along with the excise duty at all on the heavy fuel oil , are so far removed from the values of the highest applied within the union . 
so i repeat , the commission is unable to ensure that member states to change what the level of excise duty . 
the rationale of economic thinking supports mr martin &apos;s statement . 
however , if i had a special case , which illustrate that decision , that of a particular region or , i do not know , i would welcome any reference back to my colleague mr barnier . 
the removal of borders is certainly a very important step but we must nevertheless be able to prepare these minorities . 
this means a reduction or the dismantling of the activities for a variety of sectors . 
how can envisageriez-vous it , if the swedish government , during its presidency , had a demonstration of power by taking action for the restoration of the financial aid to ecpat from sweden victims of this disaster ? 
remove the aid , this would , therefore , go against the priority that the council and parliament have had it that the future be given to combating the traffic of paedophiles . 
i want to thank the commissioner is going on . this should be pointed out . in short , but very clear about the matter . 
this regulation , very comprehensive , is affecting a number of the regulations for hunting and 
i would like the commission gives us a guarantee that the rules contained in this document , should certainly not be applied to meat from animals hunted consumer family . 
i shall present to the council and the european parliament a report on implementation in the member states of the community legislation on animal welfare during transport . 
as i mentioned , the commission is working on a report on the functioning of a directive on the transportation of animals in member states . 
these criteria are currently being discussed . 
with regard to these aspects , the commission has been preparing a mandate to the standards institutes in order that they should work out rules on the use of computers for long periods . 
the author is not present , question no 12 lapses . 
we must say that if we should avoid any political contact with the governments or regimes whose we fundamentally disagree with the attitude with regard to human rights , those responsible and heads of government are to travel a great deal less abroad . 
aung san suu kyi , emphasises , in a long time in order for such a dialogue to take place . 
in such circumstances , it may well be that such a mission to be able to be justified . 
the eu member states provide the bulk of the budget of the osce , and the european commission has also provided 5m for genetically equipment to the procedures for authorisation . 
it so happens that i was present at these elections among 200 other observers , who came 52 countries . 
mr president , as other speakers have already pointed to us today , i congratulate mr titley for his report . 
mr president , the european defence industry is certainly important , but peace in the world it is referred to at least as much . 
it is certainly very confusing to see the other european countries will become involved in the manufacture of armaments . 
the arms trade is putting forward the singular character that it is the poor countries which are mainly the purchasers of the countries which , for just anything of any one side , cannot find money , but which to bring in order to buy weapons . 
in his first report , the committee of experts independent stressed that the internal control and audit constituted activities completely separate , even in the conflict - which are not to the same department . 
secondly , the european commission &apos;s proposal would have the effect of imposing on all the institutions , the obligation to nominate a auditor internally . 
parliament has not yet received this official text of the proposal but we managed to see an provisional and i hope that the entire text is soon to be forwarded to parliament , i also understand the commission &apos;s wish to ensure that the text is both legally and linguistically irreproachable . 
it is also important to retain the option to appeal to an ex ante control independent structurally decentralized without doubt , but when there will certainly not be subordinated to the director-general who are in charge of our directorate-general is the subject of control . 
however , to date we do not know and as long as it will be the case , i would like to ask this house to accompany the process of reform of the european commission with a bit of scepticism . 
i believe that the committee on budgetary control made a serious discussion on this subject and the commission is certainly a good idea if it is based , over and over again , on that in pursuing its purview reforms . 
unlike the audit , the financial control classic verifies already up and the budget procedure and that maybe the contracts may be no more have been signed , and payments carried out . 
there is a certain lack of interest , which i am sure that the commissioner will take due note so that we achieve the utmost urgency to the aim of this reform which the report marks the beginning . hulten 
i would like to thank the two committees - the committee on budgetary control and the committee on budgets , for this debate a very heated and the rapporteurs mr van hulten and mr dell &apos;alba , who was unable to attend today . 
i think that is so much , my view , i am sorry for not providing myself imagined . 
it goes without saying that we do not pretend through harmonizing legislation in matters of protection of minors , not only because , in accordance with the subsidiarity principle , each member state is sovereign on this matter , but also the prevailing view cultural and moral and hence the assessments of these issues , are considerable disparities between the different countries . nor is there , for example , no single definition of the concept of a minor , violence , and so on . 
i believe we need to educate the children to be able to benefit , in accordance with good practice for the latter , and force those parents to equip their children to look at what is worth it and to leave aside the rest . 
he must nevertheless insist similarly to the fact that we should not rely on just introducing mechanisms filtering help ensure that there is seeking to have programmes that have been selected and accommodate furthermore broadcasters of programmes from their responsibilities . 
i must say , by way of conclusion , to the concern of the liberal group , compared with the growing supply of television programmes that involve in violence and sex . 
if , therefore it is essential that all parties involved , beginning with the children and , through to their parents , teachers , the countries concerned , the european union , to conclude with distributors and producers of the programmes , can contribute ideas on this subject and should learn how to behave and react in the face of all these proposals and to the effects they can have on individuals . 
this is not to generalise and no possibility of simplifying them , even though the time is running out in the european parliament , but the examples are multiple . 
however , subsidiarity must be used to do something , rather than of smokescreen yalta did . 
the aim of such a study is to assess the effectiveness of the approach proposed , an approach based on the principle of self-regulation , and my services have just demonstrated in the work and provided a questionnaire to the member states . 
nobody has more respect than i am to mrs reding and the staff to which she or comes within the commission , so i am sure that , when she responds tonight , it will be able to clarify the points that i have raised and that it rather than being just make a statement . 
that is why the question of the researchers must be kept to , mr evans . 
it would be wrong , i believe , that the commission have now , in private . 
i am very satisfied that the rapporteur has taken account of the possibilities of the citizens of the candidate countries to be affected by the recommendations in the area of mobility . 
despite the positive opinion of the courts , the recommendations of the commissioners and the actions taken at council level , nothing has been done to resolve the situation of the assistants , whose status has been reduced by the italian minister for education . 
mrs reding and mr busquin and his directorate-general do neither of the training of researchers , of either the problem of the recognition of third cycles of the training of doctors . ni 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you , firstly to the rapporteur , but also to all those who are committed , within the competent committee and in this chamber , so that mobility will become reality . 
our heads of state and government , the regional governments , national , we found out that education plays a role if we want to develop the economic , if we want to develop the social . 
mr president , this is a great honour for me to welcome you to the european parliament . 
once again we are going to steer the destiny of europe , like to do so . ( da ) the statesmen had from the 1950s . 
economic recovery of europe is today an established fact . let us then use the current weakness of the euro , which promotes the superb competitiveness price , to hasten a rebond productivity that innovation can be generated in the fields of instruments and means of production and of organisation of markets . 
and will this conquest is at this point we have gained that awareness of the expansion will weakening , two generations , from now on , do not recognise that this europe , composed of interdependence and open borders . 
this sector that is emerging is opening up to women , a wider access to the labour market . 
the second theme of this conference of ministers , refers to the reconciliation of family and professional life . 
firstly , the employment guidelines , this time have now been equipped with quantified objectives , so it is therefore proposed to increase the employment rate among women to 60 % by 2010 . 
the expectations of society are strong , and this has not gone unnoticed by members of the convention that have been happier with a charter &quot; genderly correct &apos; . 
the participation of women in the labour market makes a lot less than men , this difference is in some countries , especially under accentuating southern europe . 
i happen to a man , but in the european union , the men and women do not have the same chance of success . 
this takes place should possibly be emphasised in this chamber . 
mainstreaming has been repeatedly mentioned here and i can only endorse what has been said , namely that where economic policy for example , it is vital to get down to thinking about the aspect between men and women yalta did . 
women , by a selection of the very nature , is the recommendation does the future of humanity in its own territory . 
i am therefore really embêtant nevertheless , these women who , from the depths of their business , or of the accounts of their act , are rejecting the bright future for the euro . 
the report before us is based , however , on an interpretation of the principle of equality . fully-contrived 
the human being is a creature independent and responsible in its relations with , on the one hand of god , who represent its creator - and on the other . they are our fellow human beings . 
it is three years since then . 
with a percentage of women , by 30 % , the european parliament is running ahead of the other institutions . 
in almost all sectors of activity , there is still of profound inequalities . 
i thank her for her great commitment and her work in favour of gender equality . thoughtful 
women are forced to temporary work , debates and which are more strongly to insecure employment and unemployment , paid for an average of 30 % less than men . 
that is why we must assess the true situation of women , we need to develop indicators , we must continue to give a binding force to our political action , so that the progress are of benefit to all and not just to some of them . 
that is obvious . nor will the community that i am - since i , too , like many of you , i have a pathway associative d thirty years - knows movements associative movements feminists movements intellectuals , of course , are to move this matter and that of work into this , we are now in our place in our role of responsibility , an institutional role . 
i have not given up hope , even so , to improve this text . 
i completely support the comments of the report and the suggestions by honourable members who have spoken about the need to change the nature of the report . 
mr president , commissioner , this morning , we shall be voting in favour of the council &apos;s common position , through which we will adopt a definitive reform of the customs code common to all . 
finally , amendment no 11 , calling for this amendment to the community customs code should enter into force before 1 january 2000 , does not make sense . 
i believe that , once again , the conciliation procedure , the agreement between the institutions , has worked . 
the community customs code has enabled us to harmonise and simplify legislation in a transparent manner , and which must always be the ultimate goal . 
given the delicate balance that characterises the whole subject , i think that after a conciliation procedure , on the assumption that this debate be extended - would be , rather , is uncertain . 
mr president , with regard to the final vote , i would just like to inform the house that the commission published yesterday , a press release and that commissioner reding has spoken yesterday evening in a way that , as far as the report we have just adopted on the mobility of teachers , students , teachers and those in the educational community generally , to help them to report travel in europe in order to study , work or is able to carry out any activity which is linked to the field of education , the commission will not accept any of the amendments and he was asked to do anything to ensure that these agreements are respected . 
mr president , it also demonstrates a translation error which has not the same level as that which has just been held responsible . 
we liberals are in favour of this fact – in the interests of a functioning internal market - the submission from beneficial , however , the committee on legal affairs on the commission , so that corruption is drafting a legislative proposal on the place of birth of the debt . 
this proposal if it is a step in the right direction , without it will not entail fewer defective uphold under the evans report remedies yalta did . 
our position on the recommendation of the european parliament and council directive on free movement within the union is positive as a matter of principle , but we wish to make a comment on the following : 
we should incorporate in the association agreements which have been made , or will have to be concluded between the european union and the candidate countries of the rules which prohibit the discrimination of group protected by article 13 . 
the usual principles of the rule of law that is why they are gradually coming organisms under the effect of a design of the fight against discrimination , to which the european parliament and commission are too happy to throw its for putting them into all the national laws . 
i deemed it essential to broaden the scope of the programme to ensure the implementation of article 13 of the treaty . 
furthermore , the snp consider this as a means to achieve the underlying objectives of the european union for the fact that this equality in the field of employment is the only way to combat social exclusion and participates in the intensification of the mobility of citizens within the union . 
this is already very difficult for the authorities . 
this is an area in a very complex and the proposals are both ambitious and extremely important . 
but also discriminating against those individuals and organisations in the light of the bible as an expression from words divine lack infallible governing all disputes and forcing those loyal to employ those who spread and practise sexually completely at odds with the ethics of holy writ . 
this distinction is detrimental to the transparency of the financial regulation . 
although there were of heartfelt sympathy to the idea of a political direction of european production and export of arms , we are sceptical of the titley report , above all for the following reasons : 
i support the report by my colleague gary titley , and consider as him that the commercial practices responsible arms are a part of the acquis communautaire , and that therefore , the applicant countries should be involved in the development of the code of conduct on arms exports , code of conduct which should be legally binding . 
the european states have been selling arms to indonesia whose army is involved in the massacres in east , to the moluccas . 
once again we are seeing this difficult and sensitive issue of protecting our children , which will be the companies of the future : to become the object of particular marketing , as a means towards even stepped up . 
minors differ adults . 
do all i would get involved personally , so that , at european level , the governments of the union are about implementing the appropriate legislation in order to put in place the necessary protection mechanisms i have referred to . 
the 1998 report examines in particular , the phenomenon of unemployment and economic impact of underemployment among women . 
equal opportunities in employment , in the participation of social and health and the other hand , however , cannot be seen in a context of policies which , overall , reactionaries infringe upon human dignity , without the prospect of social justice - a society of unemployment , underemployment , without a welfare state , a society of charging and mercantilisation basic yalta did . 
b5-0784 / 2000 by mr salafranca sánchez-neyra , on behalf of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , on the crisis situation in peru ; 
the support that the united states has given to this man has been that these aspirations , and this influence has to be neutralised in through a different influence positive case , there is on the part of the european union , in favour of human rights and full development of democracy . 
it is appropriate that the european union took an active and to do it quickly . 
that is why the commission to study at the moment with the member states how can a real help can be provided in the best possible conditions as regards : the preparation of elections , pluralist and democratic system and of their control . 
the basic political problem , as the resolution , which is also a way to try to influence the situation in afghanistan , that is to put pressure on the very large neighbour , pakistan and i would also add the other great neighbour , the republic of china , with whom pakistan enjoys excellent relations , with whom pakistan collaborates at military level , at the level nuclear . 
the resolution produced by all groups , and that it is my honour to speak up for here , is along these lines . 
must the eu would do to once again a good impression , if it were brought up a political initiative in the united nations in order to achieve a peaceful resolution of conflicts in afghanistan . 
the urgent resolution , who is now put to the vote , ask that the concerns expressed by this parliament on many occasions , to be translated into concrete initiatives . 
the thorny question is now whether this barbarity religious suffices for creating any front oppositional internationale contre les hosts conspirateur the jihad , osama bin laden . behalf of the union for europe 
human rights 
at present , for example , a priest colombian oliveiro medina originates , in brazil . 
in this regard , i would like to emphasize that the commission supports the peace efforts of president pastrana and doing its utmost in order to bring about a lasting peace in colombia . 
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that this resolution is important because it talks about a decision in favour of the macedonian government , and unfortunately not the whole of the political groups in macedonia , on the law on higher education that goes in the end make it possible for young people from minority groups , and particularly the albanian minority , to study in their mother tongue . 
to an extraordinary , this cooperation has led to a bill , which was approved in parliament by a majority in parliament . 
mr president , i especially pleased to add my voice to that of lagendijk to eulogise the merits of mr van der stoel . 
mr president , in reconciliation franco-german , general de gaulle has been talk of &apos; peace of the brave &apos; , by that is a compromise can be maintained by those listening patriots on both sides . 
the implementation of appropriations is provided for in the proposal for financing , which is being submitted today - perhaps , however , precisely at this moment – in the management committee for example . 
it is striking that the government and the shipping company is determined to affirm that the &apos; samina &quot; meet all safety standards . 
mr papoutsis gave already &quot; dismantled &quot; a service which is very important one of his ministry , the leadership of the inspection of ships to be traded . 
i hope that today , and that over the coming days and weeks , the commission will make the measures they intend to take against member states which have been shown to negligence on maritime safety . 
just as dangerous is the conduct of supervisory bodies and of the classification society , in , working as a private company for profit , is controlled by the shipowners same that it is supposed to monitor . 
the first one king greek has been an bavarians . something which is reflected today still in the sense that a particularly high number of bavarian travel to in this wonderful country . holiday 
the relevant member of the commission , madam vice-president de palacio , has , therefore , intend to bring in its work programme for 2001 , the question of a review of the current directive with regard to safety standards for ships used to transport passengers . 
the next item is the statement by the high representative for the common foreign and security policy on the situation in the middle east peace process and on the elections in yugoslavia . 
let us hope that over the next few hours , i can give you a better , but unfortunately i cannot do so now . 
the serbian people will then have the chance to do on this part of the family of european peoples and to work with neighbouring countries in building a peaceful and stable . 
but camp david did not occur in a failure either . the gap between the parties has been substantially reduced and a few subjects taboos difficult were overcome . 
like other speakers , i would like to express my concern about what goes on and i want at the same time to say that , once you begin to talk to that region , it is perceived to denying a minefield and that , whatever that may say , we can be certain of obtaining medical reactions . 
it was expected in a long time to an explosion simple one ; difficult to believe in the cause of peace when , for since the signing , on the settlers have risen from 141 000 and over 200 000 , when there is no work to encourage its children , as my friend talal which lies in the settlements , maybe over bricklayer a land which belonged to his family . difficult by the soldiers vous hampering vous relocated . 
the latest reports that i have received - and i regret having to leave the house in order to travel to paris - show that the parliament building with the demonstrators to belgrade and the offices of the television companies are currently handled by the opposition . 
it is absolutely essential to get out of a deadlock dangerous , in which each partner , is considered as unthinkable sovereignty and the other on the holy places than itself consubstantiels yalta did . 
israel should not only be convicted if leaders palestinians continue to use violence as an option in the negotiations . 
we can only hope that all those members of the army and police - in short , these are all people who are there to serve the people , not a dictator like milosovic - joining raviseront nor anything against the peaceful demonstrators . endeavour 
we always have the objective - and i subscribe to them - of a new state of yugoslavia , a yugoslavia with states self-governing , kosovo and montenegro , but we must not see a new , a new conflict , a new dislocation conflict ; a fresh violence . this is not our aim . on the contrary , a new yugoslavia must be obtained , a yugoslavia which is democratic , with the peoples of europe , still remain a voluntary basis , not in terms of coercion , not by the brutal , but because they are convinced of the possibility of seeing , instead , be a federation with a democratic future , a democratic future with other leaders who , whilst not milosevic , which could then , within a period – be hauled before the court of justice in indefinite still ringing in the hague , because we want the law , but the judicial system with the peace . 
generally speaking , do not say &quot; serbia belongs to europe &quot; , what you incidentally overdrawn very recently . 
are other donors will you also for the lowest common denominator , or a large majority in the council - the answer remains in abeyance . 
statement by the president of yugoslavia 
thank you , mr rübig . 
before making some specific comments on the issues arising from this proposal for a decision , i would like to express our support to this proposal as it supports parliament &apos;s position on relations between the european union and croatia . 
it has already managed to enact laws concerning the submission of these objectives . 
that is why there should also proceed to the recovery of the economy . 
we all share the view that it must help politically croatia , but political aid amounts to a financial support is not because the political stability requires always stability economic , social and , this cannot be achieved only if the investment needed have been made in this area . 
a third of croatia is , and only after many years that it has been able to be reunited and that democracy was able to be introduced , which - and there must also be emphasised - has brought about peaceful change in government . 
right up in 1918 , the two regions were parties dissident of hungary into with one language , culture and identity , and that is how we do not agree that public authorities . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the most recent speeches , as have the proceedings of the day of yesterday and today , have shown that despite the necessary increase , which we all applauded , guarantees , in general , and guarantees for eib loans , in particular , we believe that we need a plan with regard to that region and an agreement which is durable , as well as a reflection and a decision , in the political and economic policy . 
i would like to thank , on behalf of the european commission , romano seppännen on her report on the idea of extending the guarantee given by the community to the european investment bank has to cover loans for projects in croatia . 
( the sitting was closed at 9h45 seppänen ) . 
that is on your behalf , and i call upon their relatives our sincerest condolences and also our profound sympathy . 
certainly , mr rübig , i shall do so . 
you are aware of the situation in gibraltar , where there is a british nuclear submarine hamstrung . 
i hope we can come back in the near future on the issue of the thousands of other political prisoners in burma and to the lack of democracy afflicting the country . 
they have made their dream of building a federal state with the chairman , mr spinelli , for example , in other words to transform the treaties into a constitution . 
does anyone wish to speak in favour of this request ? 
mr verheugen has given the impression that , in the current state of affairs , that ten countries will enter the european union in 2005 , and he has also called into question - and this is the most serious point - the meaning of the majority vote in the council of ministers , which we consider this matter of essential for the nice summit . reform 
thank you , mrs palacio . 
in summary , we are here all the elements that recommend the rejection of the request for waiver of immunity of mr pacheco pereira and accordingly , the socialist group joins with mr maccormick &apos; s proposal as not to do that . 
we therefore demand that this system to be strengthened and that it is applied , as was decided , by now the social affairs council , the problem of exclusion and poverty . 
the committee on women &apos;s rights recommends that the easy access to a social system with sufficient and that is worthy of which must be accorded the ensemble of the women of all ages , from all groups in society . 
i will do first of the general points about the social agenda , then like to dwell on the various fields , in an overall picture in order to respect my speaking time . 
the social partners have committed themselves to work on this subject . 
i have also seen a high demand to define a real community strategy with regard to the environment of the work , particularly in regard to health and safety . 
mr president , i think some problems remain , but we will have to resolve them in the framework of the vote on amendments . 
i should like to emphasise that individual eu countries have different traditions and ways of solving the problems of the social field and in the context of employment policy , the decisions taken at the lisbon summit to guarantee the recognition of this happening . 
the concern of the general good should encourage us all to approve the proposal to include the recitals which are related to employment in the regulations and decisions of a merger , which are today of the competition . 
my name appears on the place of the report by mrs figueiredo . 
in conclusion , the objective of giving impetus to the european social policy in the face of globalisation , about enlargement and the ageing population is commendable . 
our liberal colleagues and especially to our british conservative colleagues have tabled a number of amendments , which will limit the ambitions set out in this social action programme . 
a combination judicious and effective economic and financial policy is essential to us , and even greater extent , the extension of the social economy and of the services sector . 
all these actions will give some coordination in social policy will also make it possible to combat poverty and social exclusion . 
those that are the work begun in the social agenda is necessary to have a coherent legal framework , reconciling , i grant you , the european union policy and policies of proper co-ordination , but relying also s open legislative when necessary , in turn be rounded off by monitoring policies perfectly demanding . 
there is so far , is important not just to calculate the cost of social policy , which is often perceived by them , according to some degree of political , as an obstacle to economic development , but it is also necessary to calculate the cost of the failure to implement this policy . 
commissioner , thank you for your very interesting speech . 
the commission has defined , by now , five categories of action that we can regard as having a strategic importance . 
we insist , at the same time , on the need for measures and these connections and they complement each other for these areas of economic life , participation , of the representation on equal terms , social rights , civil society , of the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes . 
this presupposes that we are committed in one way in a policy for women , which goes from the institutions and politics , and we must also move towards a better adaptability strategies expected in the field of equal opportunities . 
i must pay for women a place that is in line with the vital importance of his mission , and i am not sure that mrs eriksson &apos;s report makes its contribution . 
the cause of women , could not but be reinforced by the decision ? 
we consider that the creation of an internet site is an extremely useful , not only because of the growing use of information potential , but also because it will contribute to familiarise the women in the world of which they cannot be excluded . 
i hope will lead to the necessary political impetus to this programme and for the framework strategy yalta did . 
it transpired that it is well-known that includes the five areas , namely the participation of women in economic life , in the decision-making process , to social policy , to civil society and the rights of individuals , and the new model , on sexual equality in the media and education . 
mr president , i welcome the report presented by the commission . 
i understand , in the light of recent events , that the commission decided to adopt a tougher line , and quite rightly so - in respect of south korea . 
this is important because of the need for transparency . 
when a decision taken by competition policy , we must take account of its effects on social policy , structural and industrial policy ; if we do not do this , its policy on competition within the ideology unspoiled . 
as you know the commission opposed this merger and this triggered a wide-ranging debate on how the rules of competition and are proving effective calculate and assess the sectors of the market . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , thank you for the reports presented cordial today ; they do not simply state of the past , and they allocate the themes of the current debate and include already commission projects . 
finally , the strengthening of individual responsibility of individual citizens could only create legal uncertainty , but a european competition policy needs to look at the behaviour and the culture outside the institutions . 
in his report mr evans would like to thank you , mr monti , that you should be tackled with determination to the problem of the policy of state aid . 
that is why the basis of articles contained in the motions for resolutions and which put this forward , as well as a need for clear information , are particularly in order . 
i believe that together we shall make progress both for better explain how this policy to the citizens . 
in the year in question , there were many cases that have the use of a quantity petitioned commanding resources and which have taken for completion by decisions made formal . 
as regards the part of korea , mr lamy , who will come here during this week , will be better placed than me to give you something to the fact of recent developments . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am presenting today to the house , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , a proposal for a resolution on the commission report on the sole mechanism of financial support in the medium term in the balance of payments from the member states . 
with the current level of integration on economic , financial and monetary affairs , the probability that one or two member states are connected for balances of payments is extremely reduced from an institutional point of view , but frankly the mechanism needs to remain in force . 
the directive we are discussing today the greatest guarantee is maintained and guaranteed varieties grape traditional that characterise the planting of vines in the regions . 
she will tell us which is as if it intends to continue to prepare for the entry of gmos in our own plates . and now within our glasses , and that , unfortunately , with the complicity of the french presidency and in total , with european consumers . touch 
i think it would be appropriate to approve the klaß report and i particularly welcome the additional guarantees given by the amendments , such as that of the committee on agriculture also regarding the reference to directive no 220 / 90 , to be amended with regard to the aspect to gmos . 
there are , mrs klaß , a second subject troublesome yalta did . 
by accepting this amendment , we will create hindrances artificial to trade . this would be contrary to the main objective of the proposed directive , namely the promotion of the internal market . 
i therefore consider that article 7 ( 4 ) has not been respected . 
this was you mistake legal matter , madam president . 
in the social sphere , i believe we should be able to also move forward , provided , however , it does not touch on the principles that are the foundations for the various national systems of social security , leaving a lot of room for manoeuvre . 
until then , the preparatory group is , which met yesterday to work on a qualified majority and on closer cooperation must be , showing a very real . 
i heard the president-in-office of the council , mr moscovici , referred to it that it calls &apos; the spirit in biarritz . &quot; 
one needs to reassure them , say to those who are concerned about the fact that under no circumstances unsettle fiscal sovereignty of states , say to those who are worried that if it is not a question of mergers , specifically by the lowest common denominator , the social protection systems , but simply to make it function in an enlarged europe , the common market and the single market . 
we believe this is an essential criterion for calculation of the outcome of the intergovernmental conference to be defined as a success , namely that the taking of decisions by majority voting should become the main decision-making baseline in the future within the council of ministers and that the european parliament is being discussed at the same for the things which are legislation in these various issues . 
but there is a fundamental issue , i would like to ask the president-in-office to clarify . 
in this regard , i would also like to ask that we took a clear stance on the proposal we are doing and which , in our opinion , has a political meaning . 
this means that the decision by qualified majority voting the rule in the council , along with codecision by parliament must become common practice in agriculture , for example . 
i too would like to wish the success of nice and i am pleased that the people of europe and that a large number of associations , ngos or trade unions , a lot of effort into the prospect of nice . 
it is already known that this model in the context of cooperation in matters of policy to justice . 
in this regard , i do not share the feelings of the president of the ppe group on the question : &apos; one a member state . &apos; commissaire dimitrakopoulos and 
i would also like to pick up on the number of members of the european parliament . 
how , therefore , can we imagine that there are clear on your doing so any change for the victims of this disaster ? 
that is why i believe that with the resolution we are going to vote tomorrow , we impose a very clear mandate to our two representatives , elmar brok and mr tsatsos , enabling them to submit a proposal along these lines on the table of nice . 
. ( fr ) we friserions correctly , it seems ridiculous . i hope that progress within the space of a nice to on this point . 
unfortunately , france has more to express its own interests and those of the large states of the proposals that are likely to overcome the differences of opinion , although mr moscovici is now trying to convince us of the opposite . 
i must tell you that article 93 , as formulated by the presidency , does not allow us to respond to this important debate , which is simple . 
if the european treaty accepted in nice mitigates completely influence and the representation of the smaller member states , it is very difficult to defend it and force it to approval in referendums in all three countries . 
mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , about the situation in the middle east , there are two months ago , in this chamber , we are all agreed to pay tribute to the desire for peace expressed wishes of avraham burg , president of the knesset , and , president of the palestinian legislative council . qurei ahmad 
enlargement , and visionary , he was to some people , has become a nightmare , as if he would bring about any changes in the balance of power . 
it is truly worrying that those who do not want to bring pressure to bear on the reforms that are a step further than is provided for by the mandate granted by their member states find themselves subjected to what we might call a kind of blackmail . 
mr president , during the plenary session in september , we have experienced and shared some moments of optimism and hope with avraham burg , speaker of the knesset and abu ala , president of the palestinian legislative council . 
i believe it is right that we have again today with a joint resolution , on behalf of all the parties , in which we agree , wisely , that both sides must make peace , what we cannot do as a whole peoples . 
we are , the opposition and i believe we have the right to vote on resolutions , in favour of the charter , different from those of the majority . 
this procedure is not acceptable with regard to democracy and integration policy . 
any other approach is a dead end . 
examples of them : the european limited company , tied up liberalisation and privatisation of postal services in the wider community , trying to open up the energy sector to competition , or the commitment of the process of harmonisation of taxation . 
nonetheless , we have referred to the intelligent work , and open , which led to this charter and the national parliaments , representing national opinions , have taken part in this work . 
finally , i would like to thank mrs randzio-plath for her speech she made just now . 
&apos; on our left-hand , karl marx , cape thinker revolutionary denouncing raillait the very idea of human rights , thors was because people theory does not exist , according to him , and that mankind should not be anything . 
thirty years ago , with major countries of southern suffered dictatorship and the east survivait been suffering under the soviet union . 
at any rate , do not kill it today . 
anyone who has studied the problem knows that there is a &quot; enigma &quot; of the translations . while the italian version admits the principle that the island regions is one of the criteria that are sufficient for the intervention of the community , the french translation , followed by other languages , is a different concept of and the english translation exactly is half-way ; lend itself to the two ways . 
i come back , therefore , now on all of them , but briefly in order to allow time for our debate . 
suffice to say thank you to crop , and to emphasise that there have in its text simply government entirely low on president prodi - it talks in good part , of course - and even the point that he did not entirely been told how he would like to make it hard to the constitution . 
secondly , there are , here too , that is inevitable , but it is nonetheless open to debate , a portion of arbitrariness , as we know , in the choices made by the institute in florence . 
i understand that our italian friends - for many of them either - is , between the different language versions of article 158 , paragraph 2 of the treaty , certain nuances , perhaps even for differences , which may give rise to conflicting interpretations . 
i fully share parliament &apos;s wish that the fundamental principles in general may be maintained , but i have noted , mr gil-robles , to open up to you to show to soften some of these conditions , that is paragraph 11 of your resolution , and i would like , in this regard , reveal a degree of caution . 
we need in the first phase of a constitutional treaty that synthétiserait clearly and easily understood the basic principles of the existing treaties on which was based : &quot; the european union . 
it is a good thing that our rapporteur , would like to stress the demand that the power of initiative of the commission and the participation of parliament , at least according to the consultation procedure , must be the norm in all areas of enhanced cooperation . 
this work must not under any circumstances be a pretext for delaying enlargement . 
it has always been the case that the task of european democracy has been to reduce the power of the prince . 
we should each questionable first at what exactly is the wish of our peoples for a europe of tomorrow . 
finally , what is serious in the report by mr olivier tautology is that it also a constitution tripotage yalta did . 
unfortunately , our hopes have proved to have been in vain , because , among other things , the islands have been paying for the language versions established different from this point . 
in order to achieve this objective , we must ask the council of nice will have to open the perspective rénovatrice , far-reaching attract political consensus and support of citizens . 
i hope that the french presidency will find a more efficient and more creative , to reassure the candidate countries and the public across europe that we are addressing not only technical issues that are important , but above all , of the policy for giving stability to our continent by the enlargement a matter of certainty and guaranteed in the european union . 
as far as the report of mr duhamel , who has , up in its content would be good , important to the end of a lengthy process , i feel i must highlight two amendments that our group has tabled . 
mr president , the question of the committee on constitutional affairs , presented by mr napolitano , relates to something very concrete and i think the answer from commissioner barnier and the president-in-office of the council , mr moscovici , is very clear . 
we now need is evident in nice has the necessary political will to ensure that these proposals , together with others who have been expressed from time to time , constitute , by means of the treaty of nice , a whole have been completed , an institutional framework which will enable the european process of making progress in the right track , but also for the european union to be able to welcome the new member countries in a constructive manner and above reproach . 
report ( a5-0290 / 2001 ) by klaus-heiner riis-jørgensen , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission report on competition policy - xxixe 1999 &#91; sec ( 2001 ) 720 - c5-0302 / 2000 - 2000 / 2153 ( cos ) &#93; 
i said to the sessional services yalta did . 
such texts confirms that the role of the european institutions , including parliament , is to be at the service of a small layer of wealthy . 
because the parliamentary immunity is of the autonomous region in this house we have a power of appreciation as to the requests made , and above all with regard to the persecutionis . 
the foot fig or cep element is crucial for ever-diminishing optimum grape and wine as well , both in terms of the quality and quantity . 
with regard to the technical scientists , as la micromultiplication viii ( vitro ) , it should be a provision disregards arms production in terms of the culture in vitro as from méristèmes . after all , experience and testing by a number of institutions for for many years to show us that you study mutations en these points of the plant yalta did . 
and if they have reported to the shareholders of the societies in question , they were , by contrast , a high price paid by their workers , their families and by all of society . 
i cannot answer this question , mr fatuzzo , because this is an explanation of vote . 
for the purpose of these grants of state , is seen as a small or medium-sized enterprise in any company which employs fewer than 250 people . 
the principle of the social regulation by the laws of the market is tending to abolish the human being and its creativity as subjects of the economy and production , and has no interest as we , particularly in the wellbeing of individuals who are in order to be of interest to the man of businesses . 
attempts to further reduce the measures of protection of workers , frontal assault against their vested rights , together with the initiatives taken to bring to a minimum the relative importance of the public sector and the balancing role that may be played by the state aid , will only serve to increase the dissatisfaction of the people and others drew attention to workers on the possibilities are driving hours of the campaign and of the resistance . 
the report ( a5-0236 / 2001 ) by mr colom i naval , on behalf of the committee on budgets , on the interinstitutional agreement on the financial statements . 
we therefore have led both payments under headings 3 , 4 and 7 in a position which guarantees a cover for a 25 % of commitments entered into in 2001 , in every budget heading . 
if we take into account , furthermore , in the domains to actions in the labour market and to the local employment initiatives , we are talking of close to eur 150 million proposed for the promotion of employment in heading 3 . 
surely it is unacceptable that , of the budget procedure with the budgetary procedure we have fought again where the same subjects . according to observance immutable . 
this parliament represents the citizens of europe . 
in the field of foreign policy and security policy , the council should see to it - in the future too – at this will remain so . 
by the committee of regions instils less concerned about at the present time . 
we take the view that amendments are still needed and would ask the commission to look into it . 
this is also the commission proposals and we support it unreservedly . 
that is why , when the foreign ministers to meet and take any decisions , commendable , for example . it is the life of aid for kosovo and serbia , the last one of their concerns can only ask whether there has to be money to finance such a decision and whether it is a need to take a different capacity such as that of development aid in africa , for meda or promoting for human rights in the former soviet union . 
you of close , in my own modest way , the list of our rapporteurs . 
with a development of 3.5 % in 2001 , the draft community budget is increasing on a scale vastly superior to those which are the member states in respect of their national budgets . 
the council did not consider it advisable to take over the programming which was proposed by the commission , nor in the motion for a framework regulation or the preliminary draft budget for 2001 . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mr president-in-office , the budgetary policy is always a question of foresight and , if we are debating the budget 2001 , of the budget for next year , we must establish the applications and its challenges to the policy and the budget next year and which they are europeans like talking to reply . 
i would like , in thanking parliament and the rapporteurs , mrs haug , mr ferber , mrs rühle and mr colom i naval . 
however , i must also ask parliament to be open to negotiation . 
as regards the question for a shift stateable onwards of the agricultural policy , we will submit to you shortly . ( da ) the new estimates in expenses which are needed in agriculture . 
if we consider the evaluation reports , you will see that the commission has produced a huge amount of documentation on the budget would be grateful , for example for the year 2001 provisional , including a working document that contains summaries of the results of evaluation , mainly external . 
i think that honourable members would be an act technically fair , and politically appropriate , by supporting this amendment . 
at second reading , in particular , we propose the creation of sixty extra posts within the european court of justice . this does not confine itself just to create those positions but to provide the appropriations should be appropriate . 
that is why i am delighted that we have finally found a way to restore the balance of the draft budget in favour of the priorities of this house , on employment and which we adopted unanimously , for social cohesion , and i thank our colleagues in the committee on budgets and in particular , the general rapporteur , although , naturally , certain things from the committee on the employment and social policy remain outstanding . 
i draw the attention of the commission and by this house on the following points . 
i must add in this respect that a further discussion is currently taking place within the commission , on the sugar policy , for example . 
we were critical of the shortcomings and the role of the commission as a policy of control ; and marginal surveillance and so we believe that we should support this policy to a greater degree of , a budgetary point of view . 
we would have to be funded , in part by the instrument for pre-accession ispa , tackle the projects , so that the resources , which are limited , to be exploited effectively . 
in 1999 is still , as many as eur 3.2 million has been returned to member states because they had not been affected . 
we also hope that this line will be approved . 
i would like to draw attention to the fact that the subject on which we receive is that of the fraud and mismanagement of finance in the european union . 
we must remember that other means are available and we should not necessarily be through a revision of the financial perspective . 
personally , i have not endorsed . after all , one or two of them is going a bit too far . 
we want the citizens regain confidence in our institutions . 
however , nor are we prepared to throw something with which we would appear to be essential - and which have been recognised at the conclusion of negotiations to be with you and the such commission - and , therefore , that of new circumstances in the agenda . 
this means , however , that we must look at our policies to close scrutiny and to make cuts . 
the european union ’ s management has been inexcusably deficient : has the last year around three billion euros in unused resources have been returned to member states . 
it is a fact that the forthcoming enlargement is going to put the community to the test . 
in particular , we call on the majority of parliament to consider once again whether it really need to situate the whole of the workers - in other words , the 400 new posts in their entirety in the reserve , or whether we can give a different decision on this matter . 
it is the worst aspect of this message to send to neighbours and friends of the mediterranean rim , at a time of enlargement . 
mr president , the budget of the european union is the instrument through which the union manifesto concretely its political priorities . 
so it cannot count on much of the revenue extra arising of contributions by the member states . 
rather , that in coming to technical analysis of the budget or to the reading of the amounts provided for in the various sections of the revenue and expenditure , parliament must commit itself to the quality of the commitment appropriations and payment , and that also involves the preconditions for allocation of sums and for as the assessment of their impact . 
fourthly , as for reforming the commission on procedures and of personnel policy , we need to distinguish between a desire which is linked to new admissions / creation 97 desirable in our opinion - of a system of préréforme permanent and binding . 
in fact , the problem is that we have been giving too much . 
if it were to happen , we would be a real problem and in that mr wurtz , may be good advice . 
question no 1 by ( h-0709 / 00 ) : 
question no 3 by ( h-0714 / 00 ) : 
question no 5 by ( h-0776 / 00 ) : 
you can be certain , finally , respect for and promotion of human rights are , in any case , an essential part of the union &apos;s cooperation with third countries . 
in the port of buenaventura wuori 20 peasants murdered . 
i give the floor to mr de rossa on a point of order . 
as far as possible , debate must be neither theoretical nor theoretical . 
subject : the ability to embrace taxes tobin-style at european level for with regard to the report recently published by the french finance minister , that taxes tobin-style are not sustainable if they were put in place by only one member state , what measures the french presidency to take advantage in order to safeguard the viability of recommends therefore such taxes on the european level and world victims of this disaster ? 
we do know - and this is purely economic terms - that if there was a broad consensus , a small number of market would have a real interest in adopting an attitude uncooperative in refusing to apply the tax on the operations carried out on their territory . 
i would like to remind you that among our allies , are there speeches tips of the tobin tax . 
i would just like to repeat what i said that there is no doubt that the influence of such a tax on the volatility of the markets to foreign currency does not have been determined . 
with regard to the rapporteur &apos;s question for the council , namely the idea of a study , rest assured that i will pass it on with a great deal of sympathy to the president of ecofin ministers who also happens to be a government minister , which will perhaps allow rail mr désir . 
question no 15 by ( h-0729 / 00 ) : 
mr president , i thank the minister for his reply to the first part of the matter , but the answer to the second part , which related to compensation , i am not satisfied . 
i was in a meeting of foreign affairs when this is a round of this issue . 
so that is what we wanted to do in this context yalta did . 
i think it is the commission is the wrong impression , and that the council has made matters even worse will reduce , at the outset of this year , agricultural expenditure from the commission at the council last july . 
i would nevertheless like to point out that six months ago , in this house , we expose notably one of our political priorities yalta did . 
some members will know that my party - l ukip good arguments for the withdrawal of the united kingdom in the european union . 
in the medium term , we can assess the importance of the decisions which parliament is beginning to take today . 
for the first point , i believe that this budget is still applying the principles of budgetary rigour , of budgetary prudence , improving efficiency , more effective control of the budget , better use of resources and in the existing general of the expenditure , which is all essential in order to increase confidence amongst citizens of the eu in the institutions . 
it is necessary for parliament , council and commission are more effective , more determined in order to cooperate as closely as possible on issues such as the translation , the interpretation , libraries and buildings . 
great changes in terms of organisation are ongoing and we need a new culture , which focuses on a willingness to shoulder its responsibilities in the execution of handed down in the various parts of the budget and to put your money where their responsibilities . 
now , the commission is setting itself 1.07 % ; and the council wants to adopt will represent 1.05 % , but it is being 1.27 which lies on the agenda . 
last year in berlin it was agreed that the budgetary provisions for agriculture for the period 2000-2006 long-run gbp 506 billion ; that the 15 member states of the european union would continue to contribute to the tune of 1.3 % of gdp to the annual budget – which of course include funding measures overarching proposed enlargement of the european union , a proposal that my colleagues and i fully support . alia 
those are a political matter , ladies and gentlemen , a political matter , commissioner , who has not exactly been greeted with enthusiasm by the albanians in kosovo . 
the european parliament has just one way to prove that it may do respect and that it honours the feelings of the peoples of our countries - to adopt the amendment which our group has tabled on this subject and reject the entire budget . 
politicians and economists srbska never cease to point out that they do not wish to be dependent on our help , but that they are at present in need of such aid in order to respond to the short-term to a situation of emergency and that they are in need of such aid in order to open up the country in the medium and long term , to the social market economy and promote the investment allocated to it must be made . strangers 
the strategy of the european parliament should be aiming to do first of all like to urge the council to find new resources for its new objectives and work to ensure that they must be taken forward at the expense of former priorities . 
mr president , i also believe that it is encouraging that the council and that is almost to be able to agree on most important points , that we should be able to implement a budgetary discipline , whilst complying with the majority of the priorities set by parliament . 
perhaps this is a transitional year . in a year of transition from the events of last year and , possibly , énervants the goings-on énervants coming year . 
at the council meeting dedicated to the budget , which will take place at the end of november , in my opinion , to act to reduce by a very considerable contribution , the pace of progress in heading 1 . 
furthermore , maintaining the level of aid provided for in the course of this financial year for the social dimension of the coal is a key to the security of thousands of workers , and is perfectly compatible with the total amount foreseen . 
we need to revisit this issue . 
fishermen are unemployed people , tired and disillusioned . 
i am requesting that we are to be given the flexibility needed to arrive at this possibility of creating jobs and to redress the employment and in order to be able to put the people of northern ireland are at work , dealing with them within a proper political rather than to examine other reasons for which they could have rather want to fail to agree among themselves . 
the proposed regulation , who is now being examined by parliament , is putting into effect to these developments , agreed to the community regulations and setting up a european authority for data protection , thus ensuring that the guarantees of concrete and appropriate to that basic right . 
the free movement demands combat effectively the criminals , and the fight against crime , could scarcely be a position to be a success and not be able to effectively safeguard the integrity of individuals . 
we are aware of the case where that has been exercised famous yalta did . 
in addition to the reading restrictive of article 286 to , it would have been possible to take article 255 of the treaty as a further legal principle to widening the scope of this regulation . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to congratulate mrs paciotti on her excellent work and say that time is pressing in this area , it is actually for that reason that we have brought this matter for the first reading . 
amendments nos 3 and 11 will deviate from the text of the council , but they have been the subject of a political agreement between the rapporteur and the council presidency . 
the text should be made clear in this respect , perhaps in this revision in language . 
article 299 ( 2 ) primarily speaking politics endorsed on several occasions in the european council and now by our parliament . 
mr president , the rapporteur mrs sudre , has done an excellent job in drafting her report on the outermost regions . 
most of the section dealing with the fisheries industry is concerned is in fact , an amendment to the draft resolution presented to the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism . 
for over ten years , the european commission is sensitive to our problems and our specific identities . 
the outermost regions to bring to europe an dimension atlantic , american and african enriches this diversity of cultural , political and economic issues which we are rightly all proud of . 
they can get , tomorrow , a testing ground that will provide the most wonderful illustration of the effectiveness of its social model . 
as you ask , mrs sudre on behalf of the outermost regions , i also demand solidarity for defending the interests of the objective 1 regions , so that any reduction in funding , can be taken so long as the handicaps that they suffer in comparison with the european regions that are better off . 
it will give the outermost regions have been accorded the recognition of the european union &apos; s rights to be different , is a right to specific and special treatment , which is in keeping with their unique situation , a totally different from that of the rest of the european union territory . 
this is the message i wanted to pass on and i would again like to congratulate mrs sudre and all the members of the various committees which have allowed us to present this report . 
this point of balance , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , must be sought , for a start on a case-by-case basis . 
in the agricultural sector , we are preparing for the modification of the regulations on the basis of the posei programmes . 
indeed i believe , on the contrary , that these new technologies , access to the internet and all the professions involved here , are an opportunity for the peripheral regions or remote regions . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
in fact , i wonder whether the regulation should not contain any provision for this purpose . 
ladies and gentlemen , we shall examine it at the next bureau . 
this will happen in a job in a small , managed in a professional manner and is accessible to the commission and parliament , even if the site is not for immediately . 
that is why the over 80-year actions put forward in the white paper , are absolutely necessary . 
food safety is a concern of the world . we cannot isolate ourselves faced with the products of the united states or in the developing countries . 
it must be independent of the member states , the european institutions , and of the food industry . 
the human body must carry the name of &apos; authority &apos; is because , in english , and in most of the other languages , this term is the idea of a body , which gives , in the process of risk assessment has the powers and ability to use one another , from time to time the judgement , and that is , therefore , not a simple representative of what the others want it to do . 
in this context , i would argue in favour of food products , cheap , those that are bought by those families and is continuing in which children and young people . eat 
the second point is that the bowis report makes it clear that the european food agency is responsible for risk analysis . 
the member states have taken the measure , as is the case of france that has created an agency of national food safety . 
it is this diversity which also constitutes the richness of europe and its quality of life . 
this is exactly what we in fact the who for us : to work with his rfos perfectly integrated 
. ( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur , mr bowis , delivered a very good report and i would like to see in several respects confirm what he said . 
we must apply to the area of animal feedingstuffs of laws , directives and of the criteria . 
i shall therefore vote in favour of amendment no 16 . 
the community is the largest importer and exporter of food . 
it will ultimately be important to look at how to reconcile its independence and transparency , on the one hand , with the uncertainty of the funds that will be made available , and its subordination to the commission , and , on the other hand , with its power of initiative and the composition of its board of directors autonomous yalta did . 
however , the institution of a european food safety authority is contributing to a certain extent , at a high level of health protection . 
i have tabled an amendment which , in my view , is not insignificant , unlike in the words of mr whitehead , who says that it is unnecessary . 
in my opinion , that alone is going to restore consumer confidence in an area of policy it is important for producers and consumers . 
from now on , the policy will be dealt with more coordinated and integrated , and she will encompass the whole food chain . 
this is why the food authority is needed , and this is why we give it , and rightly so , due attention . 
that is why i am in favour of amendments nos 14 and 19 , the aim of which is making a number of principles which must be taken over the choice of location to be fighting a venue . 
this seems an attitude which makes sense . 
i would like to emphasise certain points in particular . 
mr president , the european food chain is one of the safest in the world . however , the bad practices , and the recent scandals have imposed an agenda to which our commissioner , mr byrne , has replied admirably yalta did . 
we already have a huge number of organisations and institutions and associations and of initiatives , for which responsibility is to ensure food safety . 
individual responsibility of the consumers will always be , in spite of the safety of products . 
probably not , as is rightly underlined in mr blokland . 
the existence side by side - and i have particularly highlighted this - on the food safety authority and the current system of the advisory committees has no raison d &apos;être . 
i would urge the commissioner , at a time when we will move on to the series of legislative documents , to avoid possible damage excesses legislative line and the red tape , especially as regards small and medium-sized enterprises . 
i hope that the new proposal will grant all the same attention to these points . 
indeed , the food authority is designed as a centre of scientific excellence in the service of the community in the board : consumers , institutions and member states . 
this is only right and i concur with what parliament wanted to resort in articles 95 et152 the treaty . 
obviously we still have much to do . for that reason that we must welcome the commission proposal . 
in this respect , we must attach great attention to the problem and to conduct a campaign that raises awareness so that they are not forgotten . 
the commission can and must also play a vital role in this area . it will have to tell us what it proposes to do about it too . 
by means of our question , we would like to encourage the commission to persevere down this route and to strengthen this initiative . 
i would also like to highlight the key role played by civil society , for non-governmental organisations and , especially by those very wellmotivated actors in the international campaign to ban anti-personnel mines . 
we need to recognise the particular nature of certain countries . 
turning specifically to the report that mrs bonino , i should like briefly to inform you of the comments made by the commission on the very few amendments tabled by parliament that it is very difficult to adopt in their present form . 
in addition to the search for a strengthening of capacities and property to local level , we need to be able to make the most of and the vehicles which exist , in the place where they are . 
we should focus on the actual guilty party , namely the illegal armed groups and governments who are not open to the irresponsible civilian population and use landmines profligate terror . to cause 
the effectiveness of the use of resources is dependent to a commitment by the high level , a focus for proper and management is a responsibility . 
i believe that both you and parliament are in agreement on this point . 
finally , let me thank mrs bonino . 
this is something that we must ensure , for , to come to the balkans , the west and the european union , in my opinion , have their responsibilities , if , by dint of their speeches of political , half of the region is a true minefield . 
one point on which representatives of ngos i have received of the criticism in the course of a discussion is the confusion of military activities and the specific ngo at points 11 and 15 of the resolution . 
it is absolutely necessary to ban the manufacture of mines in the european union and also export outside the european union . 
in my view we need to strengthen obligations civilian within each of these organisations , using its military activities . 
with the titley report to which we have approved a few days ago , we are doing , in fact the second supplementary in relation to matters of foreign policy , defence and security policy , which i assume that in this way , gradually , will construct as a whole for the european union and is going to become reality with the conditions and rules . 
mr president , a day of december 1992 , a young berger mozambique anddisregarded the danger here : as he , believed departed of promoting peace yalta did . 
in any event , we are going to join me in sending our determination to tackle what we need to be called &apos; the war between the cowardly &apos; . 
it is unacceptable to finland in the same category as the developing world where the use of mines , did so in the dark , and the results are in line with that . 
finland &apos;s account of its defence of a credible way . 
that is , in the same context , our efforts in those years when , in 1998 , the centre of the council of europe , that the north-south i have the honour to chair , has allocated a price-tag annual à axworthy foreign secretary of canada , for the efforts of his government that has appeared in the ottawa convention . 
- ( fr ) i cannot resist the temptation to use in our terms , or rather sinister worthy of those included in the report , in order to expose your e-pocrisie recurring in the field of employment and social protection . 
in my capacity as swedish liberals , we see european integration as a possibility of achieving solutions to cross-border problems such as those of the environment , trade , movement across borders , the human rights and conflict management . 
similarly , the requirement that there should be a legal base for ngos , in order to regulate a &apos; dialogue with civil society &apos; , is unacceptable . 
she is no precise list than in the right to property and freedom of enterprise which relate to the only one year of holders of capital . 
those who would like to see parliament &quot; echoed &quot; des pretensions viii ( revisionist ) of the most populous member states for this are both on their expenses . 
the summit council in biarritz was announced as the summit , which is decisive for the upholding of fundamental rights , of all human rights , including those it has ever been before , as if the european communities and imagined that those states which is one of them , here in the current state of chaos . 
mr berthu is quite right : the idea of a single state with a single constitution totally undermines the sovereignty of member states . 
we nonetheless share the view expressed in the report that the treaties in their current form leaves a great deal to be desired in terms of simplicity and transparency . 
that should be free and independent , it must not be imposed . this might hurting constitutional practice of each country . 
neither for the people , because not a line is the content in social europe . 
the constitution which committed the member states in an area that is very dangerous thing that could lead to a constitutional court in the whole nature of the nations of the prerogatives that the states as to how they intend to continue to do . 
the separation of powers and the rule of law 
my group is in favour of any attempt to improve . 
that is why we must hope for success of the nice summit and the intergovernmental conference in order , quite simply , to be able , very quickly to go further than that . 
mr gil-robles gil-delgado proposes thus the inclusion of external policy and security policy . 
in reality , the european parliament is waging a constant battle . 
however , in the current state of these provisions , that mechanism is not able to function properly . 
the eu needs to have fair on institutional affairs in the context of negotiations for the next intergovernmental conference . 
it is not a matter of sections of the top , but rather of a diversity which , with thirty member states will increase constantly . 
the pensioners &apos; party and the pensioners of that support it are quite familiar with these islands , because they are vital for tourism . 
in terms of our regions in the antilles , for example , or the pacific , are in the areas of tax havens that the american multinationals , kodak rule to the microsoft boeing or cargill , use for exporting smuggled fiscal massive , it was the right to equality of competition as we can add to the right to equality of all europeans , to demand from us that some of the european budget , to which the rates they are all being drawn e.g. 17 % of revenue , either on the growth of economic life , a socialist and cultures of the people of the regions that are geographically most remote of are power-stations en civilisation . 
however , in every case we are subordinate our disgust with the character of this matter to the interests of the people who live in the colonial era . 
yet the case of the meat and bone meal which is leading to a new food crisis , is not acceptable . 
- ( fr ) the commission &apos;s white paper on food safety seems at first sight to be full of good intentions on the fact that he proposes , principally to create a european agency for food safety , responsible for managing a network of early warning and to give in total independence of the opinions on the authorities to manage it . 
this is not the case of any reference to the white paper , which calls for services of the agency and those of the commission are working in close collaboration , because , and with a certain amount even keel , &apos; trade this will allow us all : the agency should be more difficult to be receptive to the needs of the vote ) services of the commission ( page 22 ) . 
if we consider the realities timing recent proposes , we can see , for instance , that with regard to bse , nothing that will cause them to adhere to the case of france , is the existence of the national agency for safe food which is competent and independence which has enabled us to the french authorities to take decisions swiftly sanitary needed to protect both populations . 
in recent days , as you know , the attacks have been committed on synagogues in several european countries . 
if we have even a single amendment , you know , the members know , i have said on many occasions - this is almost to opposing the interinstitutional agreement , because we have exceeded the margin permitted for payments . 
the whole of the funds in place must be included on this line without beware of reserve , simultaneously , the appropriations should be increased by eur 300 000 , and then take 1.8 million . 
i honestly believe that you are trying the misled the electorate . 
section iv – court of justice 
i am proposing is simply that small technical correction , if no one is opposed . 
( parliament adopted the resolution ) 
it is unreasonable that approximately half the total budget of the union every year on subsidising the production and export of global economic context is unfavourable to farm products . 
we must continue to support the european ideals of openness and democracy , and resist the pressure exerted by the groups who wish to maintain , monopolistic control is a euro-sceptic ! 
. ( sv ) we swedish social democrats and danish have today voted in favour of parliament &apos;s proposal on the eu budget for 2001 . 
however , we do not want to see a review , which - and this is a real one - can bring about new cutbacks substantive agricultural sector . 
substantial sums have already been given to employers in this industry , allowing them to move in the new regions juicy , while many of the workers – of which were cut jobs - are still unemployed . 
we need to impose a european public service at a high level , with the inclusion of mobile and internet , in response to the basic needs of employees and users . 
the danish social democrats have voted against the report aimed at increasing aid to producers of processed products from fruit and vegetables . 
- ( nl ) – for decades , in order to maintain social peace in the cities , the price of food is being kept artificially low . basket 
now it is absolutely essential that the portuguese government does not given and defend so as national special interests intransigent on each of these points . 
i believe we can only help these states if we improve the living conditions for all their inhabitants . young people , the workers but also – and is of particular concern to me - of the elderly and pensioners who are living in the acp states . 
we do not agree with this measure , because , with the application distorted the polluter-pays principle , in any event , the entire cost of the reduction of emissions is going to be directly paid by consumers , i.e. the workers . 
i very much fear that the forthcoming conference on climate could be deflected from its original goals , and that some y plaideront so for a relaxation of the obligation culmination creature the rich countries to lower their own emissions 5.2 8 % proposed 
furthermore , the development of nuclear power , carbon sinks are to be taken out of the calculations of the reductions in emissions . 
if it appears that these chemicals are multiplying the likely impact of certain diseases scaling-down fertility or are dangerous to the lives to be born , we must not remain helpless in the face of it . 
to make an inventory and study this phenomenon of the disruption of the systems endocrine of humans and animals , validate studies demonstrate about the causal connection between some products and certain anomalies in man or during the kind experienced will animal viii ( fertility , certain drop malformations , certain cancers ... ) is a start , a necessary if it complies with the precautionary principle , while , by putting forward a demand for openness entirely missing from the text . 
this process of standardisation is not there , without a change . 
furthermore , the size and number in payments for details , only relate to a percentage negligible compared with the total amounts transferred . 
that is where we had to report on the one hand that the movement of goods soften facilitated and on the other , that payments relating to this movement of goods was also too slow per about burdens and high costs . 
we have an urgent regretted in the european parliament and notably at the committee that the proposal of the european central bank has not been accepted . 
the orientation of the consumers towards modes of electronic money is essential - the report rightly points out that - and we demand that some progress in this area so that the particular characteristics commons interoperable bowed required with regard to the smart-card electronic purses . 
they décourageront consumers to go ahead with its commitments within the wto at an international level . 
according to the documents i have consulted , they are given a slice of 0.2 % at 0.04 % . 
quite right : indeed , while what is most advanced and the standards that are needed are available , the banks in softening the regulation of cross-border transfers of amounts that would not exceed the 50 000 of euros . 
just as mrs randzio-plath , we cannot instruct the banks , for political decisions , to lower their fares . 
we members , but also our colleagues , are not carrying out transfers international , on account of the committees which are too high . 
after the european passport , the arrival of the euro will be the second proof do tangible to promote of days , they belong to the european union . 
the report also draws attention to the statistical data that the banks , it will go down for each payment border-transcending . 
the next item is the report ( a5-0267 / 2001 ) by elizabeth montfort , on behalf of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , on the proposal for a council decision concerning a multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship wuori 2001-2005 &#91; com ( 2000 ) 256 - c5-0274 / 2000 - 2000 / 0107 ( cns ) ) . 
i hope the house will renew the vote in plenary , the unanimity which had appeared in the committee on industry . 
here it is necessary to distinguish and include the regions with a view to getting representation faithful policies for the entrepreneurial spirit . 
it is also in the sense that we ourselves , and i , which was submitted and supported a series of proposals , concrete and forceful , in the area of that we should get on smes , our words into reality , by giving them access to innovation and e-commerce , by their simplifying some customs formalities , putting an end to some of the sharp differences in administrative and regulatory , developing , and there is access to risk capital , as a result which is as the euro info centres thors on behalf of the role of information and magnify support from the companies , in the framework programme for rtd re-allocating towards greater openness towards the sme creative . 
the effective implementation of the acquis is a necessity if we want enlargement to benefit everyone , both the member states and to the candidates for accession . 
one must encourage their action , to promote local development from the resources to local your capacity material qu and their relationship with the local authorities . humane 
mr president , commissioner , smes , which they propose for goods or services , can only survive on the market only if their order books of are empty . 
the protection of intellectual property rights throughout europe is our third point , mr president . 
we all know that our time has become more hectic as a result of the use of the mobile phone , e-mails and internet , which gives , of course , have new possibilities . 
the explanatory statement , the smes , by emphasising that it can be for companies with at the most that eur 500 staff , that two or three craft wasn employing people and that in all they will represent more than 99 % of companies in the union . 
the multiannual programme , because of its financial constraints , acknowledges that it simply , in my opinion , the problem and provides a signal , positive political and an incentive , although not in a position to provide substantial aid or , if anything , to overthrow those tendencies which dominate negotiate in the field of the economy and which are clearly out-performing literally small- sizes in all areas . 
the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises , this is that there is no way worthy of a great deal of resources to go and get information and to seek what monies are working and what assistance is available in order to implement the administrative burden that the national governments are imposing more and more . 
this should be included in the implementation of the programme but it is not appropriate to dwell on them separately , in the legislation . 
the multiannual programme will be changing the modus operandi of the small and medium-sized enterprises . 
neither the further fortification of the borders and some of the police repression can block the path to those who are calling for a share of the prosperity which we shall all profit . 
i find it regrettable , although what the group has done as a whole was not bad because it puts its finger on the real problem and attempts to indicate the solutions . 
for this to happen , take measures in different directions . 
during the last few days , we should be grateful that positive signals have reached us in the balkans , which imply , indirectly , albania . 
i think it is very difficult to recognise that the western europe is today striving to be put in place of the laws designed to punish those who have been hiding les grandchildren qu anne frank has not had . 
the construction of schools and centres of accueils for children is a priority . 
these actions are confirmation of the fact that the aim of the european union must now be the foundation of the structures which will respect the democratic rules and which will recognise and respect the rights of minorities in albania . 
for that it is absolutely essential to draw up programmes to repatriate , and , above all , to call on third-country coordinated non-governmental organisations and to international organizations . 
economic growth itself makes it possible to overcome the difficulties in areas of crisis . 
he was very much a fact that awareness needs to mature in us all . 
mr president , the tampere conclusions were asking us to strengthen our external action for achieving the targets for justice and home affairs . 
i should just like to make three points of view which the commission attaches particular importance . 
the committee on legal affairs is calling on explicitly for the commission to resist pressure legislative as itself . 
my group wants a strong union , that is , which fully assumes its tasks , a union that establishes a functioning internal market and which will enable us genuinely to strengthen the social and regional cohesion . 
i noted with great pleasure that the proposed amendments nos 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 , which are to make , were approved by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
&quot; the same side of happening to me of the island of islay , where it is not worthy of the project for the protection of the settlement of seals local by a large international institution , because , in our view , the population have mieux endeavoured seals in the next couple of years that we don will foreseeably do so 2000 greater organisation in the future . 
we must also urge them to participate fully in a better application of the principle of subsidiarity . 
the second paragraph of article 5 of the treaty establishing the european economic community was incomprehensible . 
irrespective of the reasons that have been able to produce this mistake , it is bound to have done so for the initiatives relating to the legislation arising from the constant commission . 
in other words , mr president , the subsidiarity principle is probably the main guiding principle overhauls , takes summarises integration process of european , because it is the end , the political will to be incorporated into the treaty . 
in fact , this examination of the acquis communautaire of the eu is often a very useful exercise in order to show that it is not always need to legislate at community level and that a legal text is too detailed , to be an act legislative community level . 
i hope we can continue this debate , not as a question from the thursday afternoon , but as a routine part of the debate at the centre of the whole of community legislation . 
these costs are left , that it be on the species , or on cross-border payments . 
its failure is the best guarantee for the maintenance of the costs to the present level and of the discontent they cause . 
given this situation and to the imminence of the possible commencement of negotiations next monday in brussels , the commission will not give us - i believe - on a huge amount of information at present , given that the meeting will be taking place - that is what we hope , from that on monday 30 . 
i do , from the gallery , and with the weight of the democratic representation of europe that we have , an appeal for sanity and wisdom of the two parties , which take on the 30th , brussels , a meeting at the highest level , the european commissioner for fisheries and the moroccan minister , if , as i hope , its presence in brussels is confirmed , and also the foretold delegations technical , with the secretary of state for foreign affairs of morocco , and its appearance , also confirmed it with the director-general of fisheries in the union with its head - in order to have dialogue seriously and resolved . 
mr president , commissioner , tomorrow , a year after our last debate here in parliament , on the subject of morocco . 
i wish the commissioner and success and i welcome the presence of the moroccan side yalta did . 
agriculture moroccan receives special treatment in their imports to europe . 
there is nothing to add except that the fishermen do not understand the situation and that they are extremely disappointed that the negotiations on the agreement with morocco , is taking time . 
mr president , we are dealing with the third in agreement with morocco , which is of interest to most of all our friends in spain and portugal , which provide the bulk of the fleet , even if some of the french and a couple of swedish are also involved . 
it is basically the easiest of championing the suburbs , to defend the other is morocco . 
it is not able to contain , given the fact that it arrives in three days to be fighting a key date for negotiations , but , precisely because of bringing europe closer to that date key : i believe we must be careful as to the drafting of this resolution . 
we are talking about an area which does not belong to the moroccan side but which is administered by morocco . 
mr president , this is not the first time that the right to do it again in moroccan waters sahariennes appears on the agenda . 
firstly , it is worth emphasising that the fisheries agreement with morocco is by far the most important of the european union , accounting for over 30 % of all of the catches of the community fleet in the waters of third countries . 
mr president , commissioner , i shall not repeat what has been said in the house this morning and which claims to be almost a year . 
history shows us that we are talking here about the neighbours who have often been identified even with a difficult time with one another , and the idea of establishing a european union is to overcome such problems neighbourhood 
i believe that if we manage to give to the moroccan side a european orientation is , morocco will also touch on matters pending , and it will discuss with us the question of natural resources , which are of common resources , and that there can devote more precedence to vessels from third countries . 
thank you commissioner . 
it is not a question to language teachers , but an example , the way in which is performing in practical terms is a europe of citizens . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the case of the assistants in a foreign language non-italian at italian universities is well known by the commission and the majority of the european institutions . 
each member state has fully competent to decide the rules governing its own public services . 
what the point of this injustice ? 
mr president , politicians have suffered the problem . at times , given the task which has been difficult to say to their electorate that , in spite of the documents and of the validity of their complaints , there is a moral undeniable sometimes before the courts . 
no-one will dispute that the italian republic is fully entitled , in 1995 , or at any time , to say &quot; we do will commit more than in the future we lettori embaucherons of persons with a new type of post office &apos; . 
to date , the european commission can now be done away with the way forward is not shown itself willing to apply the treaties in cases where the number of people affected is reduced . 
we stand for the single market economics . 
we are once again in the middle of an infringement procedure and we hope that the court of justice will give its opinion as soon as possible . 
that said , i hope that our debate will help to promote a solution that is fair to the language teachers to italy . 
ladies and gentlemen , as you know , in the last month , there are four more victims have been added to the intolerable list of those who , in spain , have been killed in the terrorist attacks of eta . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
does anyone wish to intervene and to this request for referral back to committee ? 
so it is simply to bring something to the vote . 
mr barón crespo , i would like to be sure that you understand . 
i appeal to you all to know what you sign , if you sign this call . 
seventy percent trucks irish people and the irish truckers should either go to the united kingdom . that amounts to be passed by the uk to go to europe . 
( a5-0313 / 2001 ) by mr marinho , on behalf of the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on an initiative by the french republic with a view to adopting a council framework decision on money laundering , identification , seizure and confiscation frost or instrumentalities and proceeds from crime viii ( 10232 / 2000 - c5-0393 / 2000 - 2000 / 0814 ( cns ) ) ; 
the fight against money laundering is naturally an important priority for the union , as has quite rightly , that is specified in last year at the summit in tampere . 
in conclusion , parliament has considered very carefully and courteous this portuguese initiative that , but we are not satisfied with the limited scope of the revision of the europol convention have been proposed . 
article 6 is concerned , his view , allows the extension of the requests complementary self-help and thanks to article 7 of the introduction of tax are no longer acceptable to the refusal of a mutual legal assistance . 
that is why i support the proposals put forward but i take this opportunity to announce that a very lively discussion is going to be undertaken with the council to comment on the common position shortly on the second directive to combat money laundering . 
if &apos; the european police force &apos; rule has been receiving this gift from heaven d self-control achievable , it will make every attempt to curb the vague desire for democratic control of the european parliament in view the current shortcomings in the sphere of the structure and the lack of unity on the substance . 
i am delighted at this debate , 
this must be done by means of a majority vote , while we are proposing a two-thirds majority - and we also want to see parliament be involved in the executive director , if necessary , by a vote to a two-thirds majority . 
he would at the support of the public and it is necessary for the future . 
question : is there a political state in europe or a part of the world , the united states , for example , which has already brought up the single legal jurisdiction and did obstacle laundering dirty money fighting effectively , or is it , will and on behalf of a genuine problem , we sought to foster the communitarisation of institutions that are vital . it relates to national independence and to national sovereignty of member states ? 
this report contains a visa on the appeal of geneva , for whom the ppe group is going to vote , not because we are opposed to the geneva appeal , but simply because , as parliament , we must ensure that there is legislation for quality . 
let us not forget , however , it is to provide europol in workforce and with adequate financial resources to ensure that europol should be able to assume the responsibilities which him transfer yalta did . 
this framework decision aims at fighting organised crime , which is at the origin of money laundering , and not in opposition to the minor offences implications penal inferior , which might lead to distortions of the objective of this framework decision if they should be considered in this context . 
that is where the states , thanks to the police and judicial cooperation , can intervene with the most effective way to combat organised crime . 
however , in all honesty , i believe that this initiative is not the ideal opportunity to take decisions on this matter . 
the picture may look gloomy , but there is reason to hope pact ! 
mrs gebhardt &apos;s report pays particular attention to these three points . 
the member states of the european community to be observed on the basis of their systems legislative , executive and judiciary , in accordance with the principle of fundamental rights and common values . 
we , too , like mrs palacio , we hope that this unit of judicial cooperation will be relying on very quickly to being a provisional solution , but , as radical members , we are not willing to renew the experience gained with europol , when the constitution of the unit &apos; drugs &apos; has given rise to the creation of an superorganisme fast-changing and expansion , and which is beyond the democratic control of the national parliaments constant and european parliament . 
it must be based on talks of commons and given a broad political support . 
without a degree of cooperation , we will not be able to maintain the rule of law in the european union , which applies the principle of free movement . 
criminals should not be in doubt on their very nature supranational . 
the commission welcomes your report , mrs gebhardt . 
and this work for the follow-up , in fact , precisely , part , although here it will genuinely slightly late . 
finally , concerning the fisheries industry – which is a hobbyhorse of mine - , i assume that all three sides will make every effort to guarantee a positive development in the future . 
one only has to suggest that we need to review the whole procedure , not only with regard to the court &apos;s annual report to be published tomorrow , but also with regard to the special reports , such as these . 
i would like to highlight only a few points which are crucial , in my view , for our future cooperation for control of the expenditure relating to research in general . 
i would stress , however , for a fraud or misappropriation wasn were observed . 
however , i would point out one point is that a financial burden should be a joint is not practicable strictly speaking within the framework programme , which is intended to form consortia composed of various bodies , universities , smes and large enterprises , research institutions public or private . 
therefore , the procedure is set in motion , but we are entering the field of jurisdiction of member states . here , we are not always the masters of deadlines . 
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
madam president , allow me first of all , as a member from salzburg to offer you my heartfelt thanks for your words of condolence and reasons of comfort to which you have worked out yesterday . 
i believe that , if we want to ensure that this charter is the foundation stone of a european constitution , it must be complementary to the future . 
so , these are obviously a major political decision and of a new opportunities to show the citizens of europe the full extent of this initiative . 
the charter is , then , a text which is entirely consistent . 
i am sure that the members of the convention , and this will be here at all will be able to confirm this . 
i listened carefully to the rapporteurs once again that the charter will be the prelude to a constitutional treaty and it is known that i , for my part , in favour of this . but i would like to remind you , because we have kept to a time when great precision in light of what is happening today , whether in biarritz , the european council was only able to find that a majority of member states were not prepared to discuss , at least for the moment , the integration of the charter into the treaties . 
on behalf of my group i would expressly like to thank not only all the members of my group and , more especially , ingo friedrich , vice-president of parliament , which has brought our business . 
the european union today is much more than an economic community , 
that is our proposal . 
it took a few weeks as labelling is the right to strike . 
secondly , it fills a gap in the protection of fundamental rights of people living in the union . 
we therefore believe that the charter is important , as a point of principle , just because she is launching a debate and a debate that we think it would be appropriate for the future , but that needs to develop further , to be held in parallel with the unification process . 
one can figure out behind the vote on the charter to a programme aimed at establishing the first part of a constitution for what could be called the united states of europe . 
but we want a europe which is flourishing , prosperous europe that would increase , which is why we wanted and have to comment on the roots . 
this scope , i want to say something about this . 
allied to the fact that we can bring some sort of discrimination , that respect is the basis on which will also be able to rely , subsequently , the measures designed to guarantee the position of minorities . 
in life is concerned , nothing is perfect . all interested parties to state the rights , but as not to defend them actually matter is not the perfect either . 
it is never too late . 
the present charter seems to me that , be a poor copy of it . it creates the confusion which come into the legal affairs , for example when it says , in paragraph 2 of article 2 nobody may be sentenced to death &apos; – here , that is no problem – and to include it or be executed ; 
a further comment to the chairman of the council : as a former member of a high court , i can assure you that the overlapping of powers of various jurisdictions extremely swiftly jurisprudence diverging will result , and it is possible therefore anticipate that different approach . 
the reference to article 6 seems logical and i believe that the council presidency must take notice of what mr barón . 
this is an important message to send to the present time , given the fragile political situation in one or other member state . 
this charter of social rights is a step backwards in relation to the legislation of many member states and , out of this game postponements , will serve as an instrument which is to amend it and nor can they undermine it ? 
mr president , the charter lays emphasis on the existing rights , whilst at the same time , working in europe is a historic breakthrough . 
mr president , the proposal and the approval of the draft charter of fundamental rights should find a consensus rather broader . 
attack memo moreover , the trade union rights y are omitted , and considers that the text , basically , is intended to establish the free movement of capital . 
thus , this charter , offer additional protection to the citizens are most vulnerable in our european society , which is good . 
firstly , they must include a reference to the charter into article 6 of the ec treaty . 
for many years it was discussed the possibility of the european union to accede to the european convention on human rights , as is the case of its member states . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the charter which we are about to vote with conviction , is certainly a step forward towards the building up of a europeanist with political europe in which we believe firmly . 
it is important not to destroy the authority of both bodies . 
my colleagues in the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights , i have had the honour of being appointed rapporteur on the respect for human rights in the union . 
the charter has many followers but also many enemies , and this means that we have listened to the critics of those who do not want a political europe . 
in both as the text would be too restrictive , or even too late in relation to some of the reforms that it would be liable to break up , and for others it would be as empty or insufficiently binding . 
i would remind you that the etuc , for example , which has gone unheeded , accounts for 60 million people in europe , many hundreds of ngos have been consulted , that of citizens , quite simply have been able to provide as their contribution , and that some of their proposals were accepted by the convention . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
our parliament must , within this forum , and during its debates , has been made clear to our turkish partners that they should not be afraid of any european interference in their internal affairs , but we are offering them a contract in the process of having more precise definition , on the occasion of the accession partnership is , commissioner , and of course with the charter of fundamental rights . 
if we had wanted to make the conditions , should have been done last year on the occasion of the earlier decision . 
i believe that this excellent report by mr morillon , bears witness to the desire to have the capacity to take this process of rapprochement of turkey , with a sense of a major and legitimate to be alert to the reforms that are still considerable that romania still has to take . 
mr president , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by thanking most warmly mm . morillon and mr seppänen for their very constructive and wise politically and say that this debate is taking place in a very favourable , at a time when we are indeed able to increase the impact on the relations between the european union and turkey , perhaps , be decisive stage yalta did . 
i confirm again that we have to be concerned about the inadequate respect for human rights and minority rights , that we have to be concerned about the role assigned to the army by the constitution , that we remain deeply concerned about the situation of the population of kurdish origin and the state of emergency which is held within the four province south-east . 
on this point , i largely agree with mr morillon &apos;s report . 
bearing in mind that this special programme of eur 450 million , of which the union will permit them to be 65 % , it says that , on the basis of the provisioning rate of 9 % , the figure is expected to be sacked from the reserve to the guarantee fund is only eur 26 million , there would be relevant budgetary qu in the event of failure to payment , because it would have to appeal to the guarantee . 
at a meeting which has unfortunately been able to take part , the majority of my group has decided to support the proposal for amendments or amendment no 25 . 
the morillon report and the accession to the partnership commits the european community in turkey &apos;s candidacy . 
that is , i propose that the european parliament is organising a debate on the genocide in armenia , the majority will follow and could we prolongerons the debate in turkey . 
any other route that will benefit from those who , in the eu and turkey , do not want membership . 
mr president , the morillon report is , by itself , perfectly illustrate the contradictions of the central european approach has to be made of turkey . 
incidentally , that about 10 days ago , the group of the ultra-nationalist mhp have heard from him any solemnity , at its congress . &quot; the superiority of race .

i would point out that , being carried that great power of control over the new data bases in europe for an organ monocratique respectfully and trust that we must at controller – puts me seems to be an appropriate time to see us vis-à-vis the central position of the human being that , faced with the power technology , must have a reference framework of rights and freedoms that are guaranteed . 
yet , we need to adopt a set of rules governing the data protection , because the institutions &apos; treatment not only data in-house ( such data on their activities , to their budget and the relationship autonomous rating ) but also of the data on citizens gathered in the framework of the performance of tasks of the eu , for example , the granting of subsidies , the survey on the marketing world competition , public contracts , the work and study after study statistical or information on environmental preparations and the implementation of legislative texts seppänen ) . 
the charter of fundamental rights of the european union is far behind the declaration of human rights of the un , or the european convention on human rights , but also a long way behind number constitutions of the member states of the european union . 
we members of the communist party of greece are voting against the text that is , not only unnecessary but is indeed dangerous . 
points which are tending to establish new obligations unfounded . 
the sos démocratie group , reject the charter of fundamental rights , for three reasons . 
that is , article 52 for which we have the most concern . this would mean that the rights that are mentioned in other parts of the document can be ignored when they will come into conflict with the objective of general interest , as recognised by the union . &quot; 
and this is how it is not , where imprégnera incrementally , via the courts and the whole of our national laws and in europe ! 
furthermore , i would have preferred a charter , not only on the emphasis on human rights &apos; of the citizens but also about the &apos; homework &apos; of our citizens in their society . 
the day-to-day reality and the transportation maritime or bone meal - and we shall indicate how we have to regulate and control that were far more the markets and the economic operators and oppose the interests of profit and the short term . 
with a choice which is as a binary one , of my vote is very clear . we agree with the advance of this charter , a step forwards , however , seriously , which is both as to content , about the scope of this text . 
between the fact of not excluding the work and action to allow that to happen , there are more than an indiscriminate manner . 
in doing so it may not fulfil its ambition of the eu which is to be a union of peoples and their citizens . 
for the supporters of european federalism this catalogue of rights is the germ of a future european constitution and the national constitutions of the member states will have to live with . 
to the end , its formulation has given rise to a series of attacks involving force . 
nothing would remain the size of the process of this year , so that we are following up to the texts and is finally co-ordinate necessarily to the lowest common denominator yalta did . 
the arguments put forward by the european parliament are completely unfounded . 
the fight against money laundering is taking place , in any event , at various levels to make and do not believe in the need to have to define the means to this type of crime at eu level . 
yet , these practices are clearly against the interests of mankind and the maintenance of our environment . 
this will be an important instrument which will bring the criminals to justice everywhere in europe . 
that is what , i hope , will not happen with the application of this document . 
gebhardt report ( a5-0317 / 2000 ) 
( the sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. 52 resumed at 3 p.m. ) 
turkey has not moved on as much to the fact that one had expected . 
the reserve , in remaining for the guarantee fund is now so low as that may hinder the european union to make use of the eib is concerned , if it were to happen to be new events necessitating financial efforts of this kind . 
it is the first move seriousness she has carried out in the integration process for turkey , so that this process to turn to a point in its practical implementation . 
until that happens , i do not believe that parliament must act differently . 
turkey must acknowledge the truth ! 
i wish to say about the genocide of armenians , but i fully agree , mr president , that it must not place obstacles in the accession of turkey . 
our rapporteur mr morillon , deserves praise for having mentioned the solution to the cyprus problem , among the prerequisites for the accession of turkey . 
i also like the reference to the cyprus issue and to the withdrawal of occupying forces , as well as the need to respect the decisions of the european court , in the case , for example , to the need for a loizidou political solution to the kurdish problem , the bombing of iraq . 
it seems to me that it is that balance , as proposed by mr morillon &apos;s report . 
i do not have to put forward , or guidance to be criticisms of the parliament and i am not going to do that . 
i thank mr brok for the opportunity to take stock of the union &apos;s mediterranean policy , since we find ourselves today , you know , on the eve of the holding , in marseille , the fourth conference of foreign ministers of the euro-mediterranean partnership . 
and when we launched the partnership , in 1995 , we have , furthermore , knowledge that we embark upon a time to accelerate the long term . 
mr brok ’ refers to the financial resources . 
mr president , the fact that the president-in-office has already answered the questions that i did not even put to it demonstrates their talents . 
we should try to help to give the people of palestine , the good fortune to be committed to its own development , their own future and the birth of her own country by means of an agreement with israel and on the basis of the security of the state of israel . 
in fact , we have closed the negotiations with egypt eighteen months ago and i would now like to move quickly to the implementation of the agreement and then to its signature complete in due course . 
over the next few years , the success of this partnership will be of even more important than ever before and i hope that this week , in marseilles , and the coming weeks that follow , we will be able to ensure that this whole undertaking acquire even more momentum and energy than we have done in the past . 
there is confirmation that the bilateral aspect on which it is difficult to negotiate , which was long in ratification and for now the dominant , in danger of becoming more and more of these countries &apos; economies fashion on the basis of their trade with the union , which impedes the development of the south-south dimension because of the difficulties experienced by the partner countries to establish cooperation links between them . 
a few days ago , at meetings of the circle of savings to barcelona , the secretary-general of the council , mr solana , we were told that the priorities of the external european activities , first of all , were the countries around us . yet , our initial neighbouring are the mediterranean . 
secondly , we must increase the envelope of regional and relationships across trade exchanges , but also environmental protection , combating terrorism and drug trafficking , migration and integration , and progress on the human rights , as we have asked for . 
( the president cut the speaker off ) 
under these circumstances , it should be possible to arrive at the extraordinary summit in marseilles , an agreement which does not confine itself to be aware of new dividing lines in the eu . 
if current trends continue , there are some reasons to be pessimistic . 
mr president , returning to the middle east conflict , there is less than two months ago the president of parliament , of israel and that of the house have , in this chamber , palestinian been united in their hands with those of the president of the european parliament for an appeal to the peace and concord . the members were united welcoming fervently this gesture . 
in marseilles also , the other summit , there were members from the association of unions and political organisations , by all the sides of the mediterranean . the latter group attempted jointly explicit answers to the needs of their people . 
the debate is closed . 
however , i wish to find in two major areas of policy . 
very specifically , the reduction of their presence on the governing board of the agency . 
it is vital that the ngos participate but also that they act with a degree of coordination between them has , if we want their actions may be effective and that it should also be extended - everywhere in the regions . 
at the same time , to provide it with a content and significance of cultural areas , not in abstract terms or generic medicines , but in terms of solidarity , we have tabled amendments that have received a positive reception in the committee on industry . in my opinion , these amendments would make it possible to characterise the economic aid and civil in solidarity with the return of regions affected to a reality and to a quite as life , but just a possibility for a solidarity cultural and institutional , and i must stress this last point - on institutional affairs , for these regions will feel themselves bound to europe , but also a civil , in terms of cultural initiatives . 
i also believe that we will need to avoid the duplication between the governing board and the council for the management and the meetings are not necessary or are members of these , while the ritual director accountable must nevertheless take the necessary decisions at the appropriate time . 
in one year , while the crisis in kosovo is still fresh in our minds a great deal of progress has been made , and the internal dynamics of a number of countries in the final analysis the role of the international community is strengthening yalta did . 
their fate will depend , among others of the success of the political answers european help . 
we are pursuing in this way of two objectives : firstly , the development of regional cooperation and , secondly , the establishment of a genuine policy of rapprochement between these countries and the european union . 
we hope that we are more efficient and quick in implementing the programmes that the commission may bring déléguera implementation . 
he is well established , but at the same time , was excellent in its relations with other leaders in the region . 
tariffs as they are asked , at the european council and within the framework of the report on the development of european capacities for military and civil crisis management , that mechanisms for financing , for example the commission &apos;s creation of rapid fund rapid-response statements , to be established to make it possible to have a fast track of the activities of the european union in order to contribute to the operations carried out by other international organisations and to fund , where necessary , the activities of ngos . 
the constant postponement of the referendum the reported failure of negotiations in berlin on 28 september last , give rise to considerable concern and great disappointment among the population . 
whatever the outcome of the referendum , the independence of or the return to morocco , it seems to me that this is the democratic path , and therefore effective , which will enable us to resolve , at the conflict . 
the transport of nuclear materials , in france is carried out in accordance with the relevant legislation . this applies to the directive no 94 / 55 / eec , of the 21 november 1994 , on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road , and the directive no 96 / 49 / eec of 23 july 1996 on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by rail , which apply to the transport of nuclear material and technical requirements in terms of prospective diverse fix vehicles marques and packaging . 
the union uses furthermore every means at its disposal within the framework of the pca in order to contribute to improving relations between the two countries . 
the feira european council in june , has asked the council a accelerate implementation of measures to combat the criminal networks that are laid down in the conclusions of the european council in tampere in october 1999 . 
i can confirm the interpretation which is made by mr martin , but to fight against criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings , and not to return to the texts of tradition , which allow the refugees to exercise their right to ask for asylum on potentials union territory . 
the council remain , however , concerned because of these crimes which are frequently conducted under intolerable conditions . 
not this evening , and that brings me to the answer because i know of the minister and i shall make you an answer from the council . 
as to the tour of the state president , the president of the republic , jacques chirac , then of course , it will all end in vienna , it is clear . 
that said , i should like to say , madam , for i love austria , and which i love the austrians in general . 
can the council , therefore , like to indicate what the response he is making to the point of the letter from mr cem whichever side it maintains that this or that is involved in the partnership agreement to the cyprus issue and would set back eu-turkey relations and that this association in the face of the conditions set in helsinki ? 
we face a situation where i would like to ask the minister has to say about this . first of all , in the conclusions of helsinki , it says that the solution to the cyprus issue is not a precondition for the accession of cyprus . 
the agreement will take into account too , of the need to ensure the sustainable use of resources and the need to facilitate the development of the sector of fisheries . 
the agreement that morocco is proposing would be two years instead of five , and it wants , moreover , that the european union continues to give the 21 000 million pesetas that it pays in currently . 
question no 13 by ( h-0854 / 00 ) : 
mr president , on a point of order , it remains 20 minutes before the end of question time and , as we are very few members present , we are not in danger of being late . 
as for the energy efficiency , the commission presented a plan of action at the meeting of the council last may . 
the aim of the european union on cuba , as drawn up in the common position on cuba , which was adopted by the council on 2 december 1996 , is to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , along with an increase , and a long-term increase in prosperity of the cuban people . 
subject : violation of the sovereign rights of greece that turkey has made turkey has disputed a de facto the sovereign rights of greece . it has intercepted aircraft greeks were exercising destined glory of the organisation of the treaty of the north atlantic , has kept to , nor for the region of flight information viii ( fir greek tens nor do the vote ) air corridors that she has reached the nerve to limnos , to enter into force , is now in addition to the opinion by icarie legal service of the nato and derogate plans exercize laid down by the army high command ally , which has led the greek authorities to withdraw their troops . 
i do not know if it also goes , at all the world but it is an almost historic which we are pleased to note . 
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen of the few members , who have found a way back to this house . i would like to start by warmly congratulating the rapporteurs , and particularly the present rapporteur , for her work and for the excellent cooperation . 
nor must we , indeed , does not spend our money , if the will to achieve the objectives that have been lacking pact ! 
i think that it forms a framework of political initiatives which we should continue working so that we can make any new plans . 
the member states are making great declarations of intent , which must be followed by a financial commitment too specific . 
both proposals are given temporarily to meet two key priorities of the european union , and provide aid for south-east europe and provide this aid as quickly and effectively as possible . 
the european parliament can be proud of these results of its own . 
clearly we can accept in essence , being , and provided for changes to be made in some cases to their wording , amendments nos 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 and 7 , the first part of 11 , the first part of 13 , 16 in part , on 17 , 18 , 19 in part , on 20 , 21 , on 24 , the first part of the 28 , 31 and bull 37 in part . 
thank you , commissioner . 
they have committed themselves to promote and protect fundamental human rights and to monitor the implementation of democracy , rule of law , equality , justice and the environment . 
finally , the leaders , have decided to press for a stepping up contacts interparliamentary as contemplated in the framework of cooperation . 
it is positive , i really must stress this - that there has been agreement on a framework for cooperation between asia and europe . 
from the point of view of the programme , we find it incomprehensible that made its office to have its seat in seoul . 
this control must be transferred to a body clearly community so that the common fisheries policy should apply to all member states and to all ships and professional and irrespective of their nationality , thereby avoiding any risk of non-compliance with the principle of equal treatment . 
that would , firstly , that we do not restrict ourselves to respond to such an action such as that of the agreement of the and its clear intention to broaden galapagos unilaterally waters jurisdictional by four countries , regardless of the minimum standards of international law of the sea or from the attempts of expulsion arbitrary community fleets , some of the few that carry with them of the standards and regulations . 
the development of the regionalisation of the cfp will be crucial for the development of local actions . 
we support the regional fisheries organisations , we ask for more regional fishing organisations , and that the commission any more weight . 
we are in an extremely difficult position , which is simply to try to strike a balance . 
the commission is keeping to the conclusion of its communication : as regards the work of scrutiny , nafo is an exception in this regard , it cannot become the norm . 
pigmeat ( coms ) 
the commission is proposing in relation to that to include in the com , a new tool that the funds regulation . 
the last increase which has grown in the middle of 1998 at the beginning of 2000 , has caused a fall in prices that are more than 30 % . 
the sector of the pig industry is the only sector to having been able to adapt , until now to the conditions of the market with relatively interventionism highly questionable , such as export refunds and the issue of private storage , and it should remain this way . 
this is a proposal that the americans have already acted . 
this aspect is fair and credible degree . i would advise my group not to oppose the report . 
far be this way to create a system which is exceptional in terms of common practice , international , people are getting closer , the opposite is true , with this mechanism should be flexible , and to the low cost for the prevention and crisis management , and what applies to certain third countries and the systems of the usa and canada . income 
in future , the funds regulatory noncompulsory will help , in my opinion , to balance the market in the pigmeat sector as they have done in other areas . as 
mr president , it must prove that it be well in this debate is that it highlights what the common agricultural policy , can regulate and what it cannot ? 
the changing market shows us that the cycle of pigs are still under way , that it is still a reality , and also that the emphasis away times better . 
in particular , we should not forget that , in many countries the farmers themselves piglets producing keep , and that they have thus direct access to the fund regulator pigs off fertilizers they sell . 
the debate is closed . 
since the last discharge , the court has adopted 24 special reports , which outlined the outcomes audit the same time highlighting a wide range of specific areas in which the community financial management can be improved . 
this reflection leads me to make a few comments on the reform of the commission . 
the european court of auditors is right in very substantial demands on the use of taxpayers &apos; money . the commission can count on these standards in order to reform financial management . 
i emphasise , of course , have been placed on the fact that it is the duty of the european commission to avoid the mistakes as official and fighting fraud , especially now that you wonder always where the limits are to be found precisely and when things do fused yalta did . 
the report from mrs schreyer , was equally interesting . 
we have to find a solution and i put the following question : could we contemplate a correction of the accounts for 1999 , mrs schreyer ? 
we are told that it is not possible to calculate . 
we might , once and for all we can say : &apos; these are the problems and we wish to come up with solutions . &apos; 
the member states to protect themselves . all they defraud , they are neglecting some form of control , and each time that the criticism has been expressed , are coming to brussels . in other words to the committee and elsewhere . 
i want to appeal to the ministers as well as to the heads of state or government so that they either sanction in nice the proposal to create a european public prosecutor . 
the present report mentions several opportunities to management procedures and adequate control , a lack of planning , evaluation inappropriate , for criteria for eligibility waves , or even not exist . 
i thank the court of auditors to please try to be sending out its views on the reform of the financial regulation . speedily 
but i think that the court of auditors has failed to do its work well enough to be able to help us in our part of our task . 
the whole process will take time . 
the seriousness of this title , is based on a press conference , mr friedmann , and i ask you , mr karlsson , why the members of the court of auditors by different depending on whether they apply to the committee on budgetary control , or in public to the press . 
i would like to congratulate the commission and commissioner schreyer in particular and the court has in fact pointed out that many of the changes that it had requested are implemented or are about to be one . 
finally , mr karlsson , while we are proceeding with all of that within parliament , perhaps you could go to the united states to assist with the counting of votes . 
it has been asked , as i have been reminded of it today many times before – that the court is to name explicitly those states where fraud and irregularities reported to have been discovered . 
the documents are of high quality , which start up &apos; a stone into the water &apos; of the common agricultural policy , which is still favouring the large farmer at the expense of smaller countries , countries and regions of central europe to the detriment of countries and peripheral regions . 
i am extremely pleased . 
on this particular point , it is quite clear that the court of first instance , has given us its support when she said that we had not only the right to mention the names , but which we have also to do so . 
thank you , mr president karlsson . 
another paragraph , which we want to see an end to the commissioner relates to the professional secrecy and said that the duty of confidentiality must be subject to the effectiveness of services of the control and monitoring of dangerous products . 
consequently , we have paid a different opinion here and most of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market can do nothing other than to advise the plenary to follow , including amendments 38 and 41 , which would reduce the restriction of export . 
one example : in many areas , products are no longer by the manufacturer , but assembled surrendered en spare-part rule to the cash dispenser . 
in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , we voted in favour , under the good advice of our rapporteur , a series of amendments , that once again my group recommends that a block to the house today . 
our amendments nos 1 , 8 and 9 relate to this point . 
a proposal was made in order to remove the amendment with notably preamble the protection of professional secrecy and the fact that producers can only work auto-incriminer yalta did . 
furthermore , the very nature of the provision of services lends itself - less so . 
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur for his report which addresses the fundamental concerns of the consumer associations , which must be accepted as partners valid in a constructive dialogue yalta did . 
in other areas , this directive has been extended to include other areas of operation . 
although the review of the directive to be formally set by the directive itself , this approach also reflects the commission &apos;s desire to strengthen the protection of health and consumer safety . 
this is also extremely important in terms of the industry , in order to maintain a level playing field between the various actors , particularly with regard to imported products . 
the only change is that the distribution companies need to maintain and make available to the request of the competent authorities , and within the limits of their activities , the documentation necessary to determine the origin of products . 
amendment 7 proposes some amendments of the references to the paragraphs . 
this is , all in all aspects of civil law , regulated by the directive on product liability , and which i do not therefore need to be dealt with here . 
this is unacceptable , given that these directives in general , there is a lack of measures relating to surveillance of the markets is the system of notification and so on . 
this is unacceptable because this is a big improvement on the existing directive . 
on 30 august 2000 , following a meeting of the office of the presidency , including myself , and where my own case has been discussed by a few , in my absence and to my close , mr barón crespo gave me to understand that was not looking i left auto-exclu of his group . 
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) 
the first question raised by mr katiforis is concerned with the word ? ? and the other on the validity of the voting order , as planned at present . 
the mediterranean has always been a particularly sensitive region of the world with the political problems , economic and social aspects which are important . 
the funding issue also involves a willingness to make a success , which has not been proven as yet . 
mr president , despite the progress made in recent years in the european union , in this europe which is promoting human rights , a discrimination based on sex remains . structural 
the only reason for its general application of all is the race for profit by companies . 
furthermore , the project of a &apos; code of conduct for the media does not seem to me to be feasible . 
you start building , i told him : &apos; do not worry , because there will the gonzález álvarez report and deal with the safety of products . &apos; 
we must not forget that it was my labour colleague , mr whitehead , who has submitted the amendments proposing exempting charity shops , and we should congratulate him on his work . 
amendment no 14 is weakening the board of directors on the commission , to ensure that its decisions are taken unanimously . 
extending the scope of the european agency for reconstruction in the territory of the federation of yugoslavia ought to have happened long ago , and should not have been linked to the internal changes in that country . 
the report by the house wishes to introduce at even greater support . 
in regard to the pig industry , we do not have to regulate the market which exist for other agricultural products . 
it makes no sense to create a higher level of funds to cushion the effects of crises recurrent yalta did . 
this shows how a disaster can en trigger quite another . 
the governments of europe do not want to upset aux parties reactionaries turks , who refuse to remove the death penalty and ride roughshod over the rights of women , nor to the turkish authorities to work ever qui the kurdish population and today , now stifle having massacred the armenian people 
you can therefore appreciate the importance of the reports for progress are drawn up by the european commission . 
i voted in favour of this proposal for a resolution . 
unfortunately , many unresolved conflicts persist always associated with the realities , kurdish , and armenia , as well as to the full respect for civil rights , although much progress has been made in this area . 
in any event , the system put in place are submitting our motion , and will impose their logical conclusion until the moment that the uncertain position will be so much , which point people will lead unsustainable inevitably to a profound crisis and a serious one of our relations with turkey . 
mr president , you know that there is now the news has spread amongst the fish , that i fully agree that they cause . 
for the rapporteur , the answer is to give the community , it effectively , resources that will enable it to ensure the direct control of fishing activities . 
a number of them are in no way concerned at some of the fishing communities . 
very quickly , a conciliation procedure it became necessary because the council was not prepared to accept these amendments . 
mr president , i agree with the support of at least a certain knowledge with the rapporteur , our colleague , mr blokland . the incineration perhaps is a source of pollution is an important one , but it is indeed now be necessary , given the very few of the recycling of waste . 
firstly - and this is the most important - it will contribute significantly to reducing emissions of dangerous substances and polluting goods during the incineration of waste - in the agents of very dangerous to human health and the environment . 
in some countries , the burning of waste , studiously sorted in small power-stations communal production of heat and power , too , is the best solution from the point of view of the environment . 
in particular , i welcome the commitment to improving public access to information on the incineration plants and of the commitment on their market operators to publish an annual report on emissions . 
the operation of the portuguese and french presidencies has been constructive and the commission deserves a special mention . it has contributed significantly to the a good final product . 
the incineration of waste must be the last stage in the treatment of waste , according to the structure , and the commission will carry out the serious efforts in order to reduce and recycle waste , and also in its approach to the integrated policy for products . 
the council on employment and social policy has adopted unanimously , on 17 october in luxembourg , a european strategy to combat social exclusion . 
but they have also proved necessary , on account of the failure is increasing , that these national systems of health . it relates to the fact that they are public and their costs are higher , but also the limitation of their funding from the budgets , which has become cheaper state in all member states during the 1980s and early 1990s . 
that is , precisely for this reason that it is so important - and this is the most important outcome of this report , in fact - that the commission draft short-term a green paper on health insurance additional question on the matter . 
the debate on health insurance in the eu must not lead to deadlock . 
according to this view , the purpose of the market in insurance disease supplementary profit is to be taken , in a way that is growing and important , as a much-needed addition to the regimes and 
these are the same people who are doctors , the same staff should nurses and the same old beds hospitals and the same resources that are of public health have called on take patient ordinary or sold to people who pay their care . 
my congratulations to the rapporteur mr rocard . 
the game and overhauled social security for residents are deprived of rules on coordination because it is not a question of insurance for workers and that it applies only to the residents . 
we refuse to accept that reform antisocial . 
health care are being funded in different ways from the member states and the role of private institutions insurance differs also . 
our whole younger charter of fundamental rights of the european union recognises and respects , by means of its articles 34 and 35 , the right of access to social security benefits and social services and proclaims simultaneously any person , residing or moving legally within the union , is entitled to social security benefits and social benefits , in accordance with community law and national laws and practices . 
the financing of the legal regime far-sightedness , and also of the pensions system has been at the centre of the discussions on social policy but also of europe &apos;s budget . 
the restructuring of social security systems in several member states are making a contribution as well . 
the green paper which today are the different legislations intrusive and damaging for tomorrow . 
the commission will immediately set in motion a study on health insurance in yield . 
thank you for understanding and by this process we are helping to ensure that the european union is a programme in this area , despite its limitations and its inadequacies . 
people must also be placed in a situation as it would have a qualification and adapt the international civil aviation . 
the countries which are not members of the euro zone least submit convergence programmes , which are largely similar to the stability programmes , while the targets that they want to achieve are different . 
ultimately , we consider to what extent will the national budgets which are presented each year are in line with the strategies that go beyond , in the medium term as regards public finances . 
in the case of finland , the public debt is already less than that objective and all you can do is , moreover , to a fashion . 
on the one hand , the umts licences , as i said earlier by the americans - were to reducing the debt used be greatly reduced . this means that we get a public debt that lies almost exactly at the level of the 60 % . 
inflation is undoubtedly a cause for concern . 
i have now the impression that the formulas that are currently being used in the member countries are going to bring about three things . respective 
this plan of action which sets in motion , as the government . i mean , we should set itself the requirement is the primacy of the public health and of transparency . 
this meeting does , in fact , right now , to compare the different experiences and approaches on the programme of tests , the ban on animal meal and the other provisions that are likely to be strengthened at european level . 
we have seen a worrying increase in cases of bse have been identified in france during the past year , partly because of the introduction of tests are random . 
finally , we must not underestimate the enormous progress over recent years , in particular last year , by establishing a framework to combat bse . 
the european parliament has always been a fervent supporter of these tests , and i am counting on you to support the commission &apos;s approach . 
a strict application of this control is therefore necessary , both in terms of public health and with financial support . 
my only concern on the use of meat-and-bone meal is whether they are or not a risk in the context of animal nutrition . 
it remains to be seen if the recent events have changed this view . 
( applause ) 
i would hope , madam president-in-office , whether it be my last speech on this subject before this house , because it really need to put an end to this problem . 
in some cases , it is necessary to do that . this is a serious blow for the farmers concerned . 
the ground from of fellow fields - clover white vetch - now have been neglected by the cap - which may provide good solutions to the safety of animal feed and foodstuffs . 
on aid to case , such as the financing of the market or the premium forage are indispensable . 
the scientific authorities clearly indicated that the development of the disease in cattle was not controlled and that they have pointed out the worrying increase in the number of sick animals . 
i heard just now to speak of tests are random . 
( applause from the uen group 
even if it is a decision are made in the case of france , the repercussions this extend far beyond the frontiers of france . 
the health of european consumers must be seen as a top priority in all decision-making . 
a general ban on animal meal in animal feedingstuffs of all animals , in other words - and also to the pigs , poultry and the fish , which is what the individual states or certain of my colleagues , is not justified . 
madam president , i would like to ask the commission for being less categorical hear when it takes a position , especially when it establishes the forecasts for the future . 
yesterday , the coordinators of the various parts of the committee on agriculture and rural development , have agreed on the proposal to devote to the fight against bse 600 million from the reserve of 1.3 billion of that remains of the farm budget . 
everyone agrees that the bse crisis , mad originally uk position is now being presented as a crisis of the french , is truly a european disease , a european problem and that it must be dealt with in this direction . 
we must take precautionary measures are now , not only on behalf of those of us who are affected , but also on behalf of the minority of member states &quot; . &quot; be , sufficient 
and tomorrow with the banning of meat-and-bone meal , there are millions of hectares extra cultivation oléoprotéagineuse who are now going to be lacking . 
i have taken a quick calculation of the process . this represents 10 cents per kilo . 
it is a technical putting at risk with premeditation of consumers and this cannot be tolerated . 
parliament votes for half the budget to promote the production process . 
furthermore , this regulation has been getting improvements and in keeping with the demands of europe . 
however , it has learned a great deal over the years on how to set up its act . 
france has to be banned t-bone steaks and many regions of france that withdrew beef french menu between their canteens . 
i believe we must , today , attempting , following your discussions , to free up the lines that are high , both in the methods and the resources and reduce it to ensure this imperative . 
we are talking here about public health , that is of serious incidents which we shall have to deal with as such and rigorous , no doubt , with transparency . 
i believe that the legislation has been respected , and i do not think i am being naive , but i do not believe it is essential to impose a general ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry . 
mr martinez has been involved in the first and i would like , here at the disposal of our colleague his minority opinion which was made in writing at the first commission , the böge committee . 
at a later date in the longer term , the objective is to define a common system for asylum , a whole . 
on 12 december , the united nations will sign , to palermo , the world convention on organised crime with a protocol on trafficking in human beings . 
the programme on gender equality for the next five years that the commission has put before us is based on five areas , one of which relates to the violence and to human rights . we expect , in this area , cooperation of the governments , local authorities and non-governmental organisations , so that , over the next five years , there are programmes in all member states . 
however , we have also set in motion , following the plan for stability and growth , the stability programmes . 
externally , it is true that there is a problem - and i respond indirectly to the fact that mr nogueira - which we must not forget , that the level of savings in europe is far higher than in the united states . 
during the campaign of charges , high levels of sulphur dioxide were detected at certain problem areas of the city . 
question nos 25 and 28 will be answered in writing . 
( the sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. ) 
after the mass unemployment to years 80-90 , exclusion threatens to become the latest the evils that rongera europe during the next decade . 
that is how we will have a basis of understanding more common , for it is not easy to define the concept of social exclusion . 
it would be useful to use some of the increase in the financial package which is demanded in this report to be financed as comparative studies on the way in which these issues could be managed . 
for my part , i think the exclusion and poverty is the winner of our society , and that we sécrétées sums collectively responsible . 
in order to secure economic and social cohesion , we need , in addition to a high level of employment , from a level of social protection are high . 
the fact is that social exclusion is an obstacle to economic growth while a company should be based on inclusion promotes growth and welfare of each . 
naturally , the policy of labour market policy is part of this fight . 
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent contribution to identifying the causes and the scale of poverty , an issue which is adapted to a social reality whose cruelty never happens dilutes step in a concept as vast and as that of social exclusion . abstract 
the proposed action programme has a legal base article 137 of the treaty of amsterdam , and the lisbon council said to us a new mandate . 
but i agree that the word &quot; poverty is a word which is politically very strong and i agree that it should be involved , when it becomes possible , to that &apos; of social exclusion &quot; of the proposal . 
finally , i should like to answer your concerns regarding the involvement of various actors and institutions in implementing this programme . 
the proposed directive is a logical consequence of the strategy of the european union to double the share of renewable energy sources in energy consumption by 2010 . 
in this respect , the member states have the ability to calculate the exact amount of their contribution to achieving the objectives of the european union according to the principle of sharing the burden and i would also say in this area of the sharing of opportunities . 
we are talking about a summit which intends to put a brake on climate change and in which the kyoto protocol will be stepped his baptism of fire . 
renewable energy sources are by far the most important source of energy currently used in the world . 
however , they must in my opinion , remain to be rational and will only be allocated for a fixed period . 
that is called , be political , that is producing a sort of competition between the two instruments in protecting the guaranteed prices and to approximate whatever is certification . 
this is the reason for which i tabled an amendment seeking to apply to waste incineration norms emission very strict in the annex v of the revised directive . 
many of us feel that a lot of energy produced from genetically waste should be included . 
in my opinion , the promotion of renewable energy sources must be accompanied by a programme modern for energy saving , because the first to present us with a safety risk . 
similarly , i wish to inform the commissioner that ireland will very soon to be competitive in terms of energy of wind power . 
the debate on renewable energy should not turn into populist campaign against nuclear power . 
this is why government commitment is important for us to receive such funding for all . 
renewable energy sources there is no exception . 
that is what we need to do at european level . 
mr president , i would like to begin by congratulating mrs rothe for her wonderful work she has done and all the members who have spoken and who have also amended on numerous occasions to the text that has been proposed to parliament and the council . 
the commission cannot accept this part of amendment no 27 , and amendments nos 11 , 54 , 55 , 61 and 57 . 
with regard to the principles on which the future support system harmonised must be based , the commission can accept the parts of amendments nos 37 and 38 which state that it should take account of environmental objectives of the treaty , from the experience acquired in the support schemes which have proven that they would be effective and positive , as well as of geographical indications . 
widows of war have been forced to raise their own children , to concern itself only oligarchic old men . 
local participation to the process of building peace and reconciliation is an important one . 
there is reason to act as a preventive measure in relation to this type of situation by offering to women , in the refugee camps , the special protection through the medium of the division of the camps . 
finally , mr president , i would like to express my disappointment over some deployed overshadowed which have to weaken as paragraph 12 : the human rights and freedom of choice for women victims of rape and situations of war . 
so let us be practical . 
we cannot allow this to continue because the rights , the priorities and interests of women , are too often ignored in the peace negotiations , and in the few cases in which women in decision-making in the areas , they are adopting an extremely effective . 
i read a report for my part , a few priorities . 
i am convinced that if women are concerned , palestine and israel , it had to make a decisive say and their role to play in the peace process , a just and lasting solution could have been found in all probability , to the palestinian question , and we would not be faced with the current crisis , which is the result of seven years of negotiations would be wasting our time . unsafest 
mr president , the report by mrs theorin , has many elements , and i believe we should bizarre rid ourselves of one to believe that the military is a kind of social service and that their main concern is to be politically correct . 
mr president , please tell me who is representing the council at present , or the high representative for cfsp . 
creating opposition between the sexes , as already devoted to it is in this house this evening is , in my opinion , an approach which is neither pacific ni constructive . 
mr president , there is no doubt that this is an initial stage when les sexospécifités , the participation of women are beginning to make their appearance in the various programmes when they do not become the norm . 
i therefore believe that these two means have to come into account in order to carry out a study of the debate and examine the attempt in some countries . 
in some cases they are exploited and misled . 
i am about to discuss some of the objections made . 
it also maintains that this would actually be created , in the labour market , an entire year on the cheap . 
in austria , and particularly in my region , is applicable for three years now a project which is funded by the eu , under which the respective council designed for women must be the best of luck as mediators for mobile aides-ménagères yalta did . 
now that the dark pages of the last decade have adjusted attending before our assembly is a sign of our common desire to see yugoslavia rediscover very fast in the european family . 
but today , following the leap decisive political of 24 september , or status as an even more decisive on 5 october , the foreign policy , of yugoslavia is a key objective , the adoption of a global approach in the face of the group of nations that make up the european union , followed up to accession . 
the most important task to accomplish on now is the establishment of a network of relationships of internal democracy in the republic of yugoslavia . 
a democratic state common enables to muslims and the albanians of montenegro and serbia to live in one country which allows us to stand together in order to build a joint state of equality . 
thank you , mr president , for this intervention , which , as you can see , has made this house . 
mr president , on page 27 of the annex to the minutes , i would point out that my vote in favour of amendment no 20 of the morillon report . 
my aim , throughout the drafting of this report , was to move forward a proposal which is politically mature eminently sensible and practical terms , both for the institutions and the citizen . 
another important amendment was that on the proposal to include in the regulation not only the council , commission and parliament but also all the bodies . 
it is also a very good thing that the institutions are obliged to - or the powers that be to enable them to communicate the documents are also to have people who live there is not within the territory of the european union or who are not citizens of the european union . 
that is why the text of mr cashman made are not just any old report . 
unfortunately , the wish that certain of preventing all cases and to provide for the regulation as comprehensive as possible and as widely as possible , was rather strong . 
mr president , many things smart were said in my remarks on the context of this report . 
mr president , the cashman report can be summarised as follows : the power of the citizens on bureaucracy . 
it is a point on which parliament has taken a stand for the motion , and on which it resumes certainly emphasis because it is important yalta did . 
we need now , during our negotiations with the council and commission , that we put up a proposal and that we achieve a result . 
according to what we have already said , the rules on public access to documents has hardly been touched upon at the commission and has been seen until now as a matter mainly of administration . 
that is for citizens &apos; rights , which we are dealing with now . 
we members of the bonino list , we consider , at the same time , that we should not for imposing a hyper-réglementation six-hour pangs indiscriminate information or to opinions that have no value too . 
this item on the rules of procedure has left the doors wide open for arbitrariness . 
they say one thing , but there was quite another . 
the stakes are the rule of law , a method of administration and democratic functioning efficient . 
this is something which we must hold , above all in his capacity as parliament . 
we hold in every case , need a new age of information and a great opportunity , provided , much to us as parliamentarians , to express our true colours . 
in fact , it is important for safety and in the citizens have the option of assessing the level of confidence in european defence policy based on facts and evidence . 
i realise that the council was in july , a grave mistake , by stating that all documents servicemen were strictly confidential 
that is why the basic principle is the opening up , but it must be reconciled with the safeguarding of the public interest , and respect certain rights , which deserve special protection . 
making it incumbent upon the institutions to disseminate such internal papers place it could produce , in many cases , that a certain confusion in people . 
at this stage in the legislative procedure , it is premature to adopt a position on the appropriateness of a direct relationship between the storage and public access to documents , as proposed in amendment no 29 , or the inclusion in this regulation to which standards for this purpose . 
mr cashman is right in saying that this is not the commission to tell the political groups , what position they have to take here in plenary . 
i should like to underline the key role played by malta in the current negotiations with a view to the eu membership of the republic of malta . 
we are not , however , for banks the right to set themselves for their demands for capital , but in practice , we would be going to do if we were not also to bear their carefully at their systems . 
( pt ) mr president , i should like to inform the house that the amendments on behalf of the gue / ngl group , i am presenting as rapporteur , have resulted from discussions with the council and commission , and are also the support of the coordinators of the political groups represented in the committee on employment and social affairs . 
he is about legislation which is very important and this is also a matter here of articles which are important . 
( applause from the ppe-de group ) 
mr president , in contrast to mrs theorin , i do not want to suggest that we say to the votes and the debates carried on the expediency of my agenda staffing . 
i am one of the members who are rather honourably attendance . 
i voted against the slaughter of whole herds as i do not believe that this is the best way to eradicate bse . 
to take measures at european level . 
second lesson to us . and so on quality , of ensuring a degree of self-sufficiency in food production , will not survive in europe against a background of free trade , global . 
the union as a whole should be compelled to act as it would not create one country might also take action and put its own economy to be in danger , draconian whilst others would continue to pursue in the normal course of their activities . 
the cap has always favoured the intensification of production or the &quot; verticalisation &quot; progressive in the production and the concentration of the earth , to serve the interests of the food industry and , fundamentally , of the large multinationals in their food . 
it is also an attitude of mistrust towards the european union which , in their eyes , is unable to guarantee the safety of food products come onto the market . 
i should like to remember the crucial role played by our group , uen , allowing them to take place , and the motion very coherent resolution we have tabled . 
blokland report ( a5-0321 / 2001 ) 
parliament has pressing successfully on another point is that the plants incineration of waste must be expressly excluded from the scope of the directive . 
i am absolutely convinced that in quatre-vingt-dix-neuf per cent of cases , it is the governments of the fifteen member states who are responsible for social exclusion and poverty . 
but , unfortunately , good intentions do not form a policy , if only out of whistleblowing . 
too many of our fellow citizens are missed out on the brink of the road . 
the europe that cannot be economically strong if it is characterised by social justice , we can only welcome this progress . 
it would be more effective , to combat exclusion , to create , for example , a guaranteed minimum wage european . 
thanks to a fresh approach , radical , my strong belief that we can actually get it through this critical juncture , but also achieve our ultimate goal , and , one day , to eradicate poverty and social exclusion in entirely the north-west . 
i am thinking of the nights freezing and wine-making cold days in winter in europe , and it is also in the north or south , where there are many older people , for lack of financial resources , are unfortunately forced to put out their heating to save money . 
and i am of course in favour of the active promotion of renewable energy . 
so i thank my colleague mrs rothe for her sound report . 
this applies particularly to the people who do not have the means and which therefore , have the prime concern to make sure that the cost of their families are still so low as possible . 
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance . 
we disagree only on article 5 of this resolution , but this is no divergence essential . we believe that by approving this extent the european parliament adopts a stance excessively paternalistic yalta did . 
we believe , not only now but for the creation of the , that some people are trying to parlacen diminish its powers , a weakening of its presence , because a parliament is always inconvenient , but i believe that the needs of the parlacen , along with the same way as us or that of other parliaments , is to be for ordinary people that it represents , beneficent even if it is embarrassing for the powers laid down . 
this is one of the questions that raises , of course has left a feeling , not only in this chamber but unanimous practically being among the many members who , because of their origin , have been watching with great sympathy for the process of cooperation and consolidation of the institutions in countries that we regard as our own . 
in our cooperation with the region , we paid particular attention to all the institutions able to support regional integration , the secretary-general of the system of integration of central america , the court of justice , more specifically the tax . it constitutes our primary goals parlacen yalta did . 
for that reason , our concern and sorrow were very large when will we have seen a slow shipwreck political , economic and human activity in that country , which has been orchestrated by the military regime of general gueï . 
in so bankruptcy , the current model of côte d &apos;ivoire , the responsibility of the west is evident thors was overwhelming . 
the leaders are now a new chance and let us therefore take it . 
the european union must also make sure that none of its members , based , with his former colonies - and i emphasize this - of relations based solely on economic interests or racks geo-strategic yalta did . 
when the supporters of watara descendirent out onto the streets in order to call for more elections , protests have been very badly repressed . 
the european union has a duty and the situation has also declared itself willing to contribute to these elections are conducted in a peaceful , fair , free and transparent for elections in december and to local elections are held in january . 
mr president , the european union has recently reported , in various declarations , the excesses of the regime of general gueï and has also expressed regret at the exclusion of the will of the main candidates of the opposition of the elections on 22 october , of marginalization which has greatly contributed to a limited , the credibility of this electoral process . 
viii ( b5-0861 / 2000 ) by mr vinci and others , on behalf of the gue / ngl group ; 
mr president , during the october part-session , commissioner patten told me , whereas it was in response to my question about burma , that if the situation worsened in the country , the implementation of the meeting between the eu and asean , and 11 and 12 december , is called into question . 
in reality , as has already been said , the situation in burma is in the process to worsen . it is extraordinary that a democratic leader of such importance as aung san suu kyi , is continuing to be subject to persecution and that the democratic league so that it cannot act in the usual re-establish democracy and , more so when this country continues to be investment economic benefit from that point , to the lack of freedom , the lack of union rights . 
i know that the idea of us know at the door of this regime tambouriner calamitous thors was vicious bilateral tiny comfort and hope very much that the suggestions made by both mr deva and mrs kinnock , will be accepted and respected by the commission . 
vietnam 
it is one of our partners . that is why we cannot continue to remain silent on the situation . 
we have adopted this resolution and we were able to note that she had given rise to a few minor improvements . 
israel is on this one of the examples of this most blatant in world history , which show that things are not so simple . 
just think , too , to a denial of the recommendations of the special rapporteur of the united states , calling for the religious intolerance , the lack of free expression of opinion and to the censure of media attention has now been created . 
the commission fully shares the concerns of members and has come round to the many criticisms voiced today categorically the manner in which the military regime has a habit of deny all the principles contained in the universal declaration of human rights . 
i fully share the concern of some members about the problems that they have described and , although some 23 000 people have already been released employing amnisties general we have to continue to be concerned with people who are still being detained for their political beliefs or religious nature . 
the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m. 
the eu has a unique opportunity to break new ground in these changes and to promote a society that is environmentally sustainable , in which we would not have to face up to the floods was partly due to our own inability to accept the consequences of such action . 
the commission must make haste to use energy and its funds in order to ensure that those affected by the floods in the regions most disaster-stricken support immediately , and this by means of instruments , such as the erdf and the eaggf guarantee section . 
taking into consideration her absolutely exceptional for the disaster , the thrust of the resolution put forward together on the other groups , is perfectly justified , even if there are already taken up recently -the 26th october last year - a debate of this house on these issues and that a resolution of parliament has also been adopted on this occasion . 
as you know , we face a fundamental problem : the legal basis to act . 
the next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance . 
mr president , i really am very concerned about this issue and have heard many debates on this subject , not only in the committee on employment and social affairs by the committee on economic and monetary affairs . 
i understand that this addition can count on the approval of the other groups . 
we believe that the objective should be to strengthen both the health care that the system of social protection , and to guarantee that there will be content to the concept of universal service , it is substantial , thanks to the medical attention and measures for the prevention of high quality at every single citizen , paying particular attention to the inhabitants of remote areas , including rural areas , within the framework of a public system unique insurance sanitary and society . 
however , i would stress the fact that all the other measures for health protection are not the responsibility of the european union , but of the member states and that health care systems will continue to be the exclusive competence of member states . 
the remainder of what it proposes to take is to heal the wounds that caused by that decision . 
at least , the majority of my group voted against and we also ensured that the vote on the report should not take place during the last plenary session . however , be postponed until today . 
this means that , if we manage to conclude our work at first reading with the council and with the help of the commission , it goes without saying that we can do so . however , we shall not give up from the start of our rights . 
but let it really possible that , let us assume that the referee should fail to be sold to the enemy and accept the idea that the texts of the commission and the rapporteur is in keeping with a real problem and a growing problem , in the words , and that the simultaneous nature of these comments , with those of the basel committee will either be the case for further development . 
however , it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create most new jobs and which are maintaining the majority of jobs which already exist . 
that is why it is important not to reject what goes on in basel , although it is clear that we have a legislative process of their own . 
the way in which we must manage to maintain the current institutional balance is , for us , a fundamental point in this process . 
the house will be prepared to forgive me , whereas in the evening is the end of this parliamentary sitting , i now come to go to draw my inspiration to a certain melancholy well to home . 
the public must have the confidence in the strongest possible in the ombudsman , and be sure that it is fair in its investigations . 
i would like to thank mrs almeida garrett for her commitment to this important matter . 
in the past , the ombudsman , that we have just discussed , has received many complaints about the lack of transparency has been expressed in the opportunities for staff recruitment . and it is a major problem because we fully share the opinion of the ombudsman according to which a procedure for recruitment constitutes very often the first contact with young people of the union with the european institutions . 
if there is lack of coherence , the applicant must have the right to point out . 
we must not help to fix a devices that can apply to institutions as varied as the commission or the court of justice . 
the petitions committee has taken note of the fact that the european commission has informed the mediator implemented the recommendation , as of 1 july 2000 . 
these are amendments clear , and very thoughtful pragmatic which represent a real reform . in other words the only reform which is worthy of the name for the european institutions should take with regard to the procedures for staff recruitment . 
a process of selection transparent , and without recourse to the confidentiality or incommunicado indicates in a democracy that can be confident in it . 
for example , there is already a way that the candidates have a serious challenge before questionnaires of examination , that the general criteria for assessment will have to be available to the candidates and , upon request , that the list of candidates from stakeholders or the composition of the panel of the open , to be published in the official journal , in the case of open competitions and upon the commission &apos;s website , where today competitions or restricted . 
only a few months ago , president prodi said that this option would be to all support , as of july 2000 . 
for this we are in the minutes . 
( applause ) 
agreed , therefore , for a weighting highest – for example , a 10 % , but that is absolutely in any case , in all circumstances . 
in my view , we can be proud , as the european parliament for having placed the question of a european police college on track . 
we know that some member states still support the establishment of the college as merely a permanent network of national institutes , but we assume that the majority accepts this proposal as a step which would contribute to the creation of an institution in the time limit of three years . 
the dutch word politieacademie reminds me of a long-running u.s. tv comical sur the police . 
let us be sure , if we have a european police college , which it may be , as highlighted in the report by mr posselt , founded on the need to develop and promote respect for human rights and civil rights in the culture of our police . 
as long as this aspect has not been clarified , i must say frankly that i cannot even have to approve the principle . 
i note that the rapporteur wants to change the term &apos; senior members of the services responsible for implementing the legislation &apos; , then an &apos; senior members of the services responsible for implementing the legislation , using its own remit police ’ , which is probably a good idea . 
for me , who come from a political environment , it is very interesting to hear him say once more , with the same hysterical wuori similar concerns . 
one might call it in the police - fresh , but she managed to heal the wounds of civil war and to show people the idea of the law and order . 
rather than a police force , trained and organised on a small scale , constantly nourished by the recognition of signals from society in which she has to work . 
the commission is prepared to do just that , if it has decided that . 
it is particularly important to emphasise that the european police college , which came into office is planned for 1 january 2001 . this is not simply a network of national institutes , destined to the training of police forces of the countries of the eu , but that it also means the applicant countries of central and eastern europe . 
according to it that is to say , this is the right way , is now beginning to take europol guaranteed unless corrects quickly its course . 
there are constitutional problems in some member states , particularly in germany and austria . 
it is a fact that a europe without borders has contributed to the increased number of marriages between persons of different nationality , which comes from either european union and from third countries . 
other than commissioners diverge unhappily a vengeance accumulated yalta did . 
but if it is true that this is a major step forward in this light , it is equally true that i agree with what mrs banotti and others who think that its scope is limited to the protection of children from weddings recognized as such by the law . 
could i ask you to clarify your view in relation to article 17 ? 
with regard to the proposals put forward by certain major federations , in respect of certain procedures , which are emerging in favour of a protocol to enable them to escape from the basic rules of the treaty , including those relating to the free movement and competition , it is worth noting that this exemption , as established , would be out of proportion to the objectives . it evidently 
the eu must not ‘ phooey ’ process and will say that is too bad if the ban on the transfer system cause irreparable damage to the football . 
i would hope that before you overlook confers fresh powers on the commission , the commission to use the ones we have available . 
provided that the details of its application are complying with the relevant rules , such a measure appears to be in line with current community law , which aims to eliminate the distortion of competition with important equitable mechanisms of a tax on the costs of infrastructure for road-transport workers and to harmonise the systems of levies in the union european . 
perhaps it would be advantageous in time to say quite simply what the british one really has been proposed , and also much that is proposing , bearing in mind the crisis in the field of road transport in england and the other countries of the european union . 
when is an important proposal of this kind is being put forward , we in this house , should have the opportunity to discuss them and to debate it as soon as possible , not necessarily for the last time . 
security is called for . 
as regards your first point , mr miller , that proposal was mooted in the house by the president and it is parliament which has given its assent to the amendment of the agenda for today . 
i agree that heavy goods vehicles of ireland are a special case . 
i am expressing to his family and relatives and friends , with all those in spain , believe in the strength of democracy itself , my deepest sympathy . 
i the note , mr dell &apos;alba . 
in order not to make it possible that the mandate of the buenos aires plan of action , valid for at the conference . it expires ultimately without success , or without cop 6 a row , the parties have decided to suspend the cop 6 and to pursue the conference in may 2001 . 
in addition to the continuation of the coordination in the european union , we would have to intensify contacts with other parties . 
many countries , and in particular , the groups , environmentalists looking upon this as an enormous amount of evasion . 
the fact that the way out at the very least vocal up by mr prescott was necessarily a follow-up by new proposals from the americans that to the union &apos;s position is an illustration that the french presidency was right to give up . 
and if the mechanism for clean development operates receives annually between five and 25 000 million dollars to be added . 
next , china must stabilise its emissions , and india will be able to arrive at rates emission two times higher . 
the usa are the biggest polluter of per capita . 
the committee on the environment of this parliament has , in the past , been to respond to the problem of climate change . 
but i do not wish to end up engaging in disputes over people , and avoid this kind of discussion totally negative . 
kyoto must not remain an empty promise sense . 
moreover , i believe that those people in business and the economic actors , who take this problem seriously . and who would have liked us to have to provide for the rules of play , which are also losers . 
in order to speak out clearly when we come to take stock , we can say that amongst the three sides , only the european union has reached an agreement and policy on climate change . 
we must of course a few rules operational clear to the market for the interchange rights , which govern develops to a value of 12 000 million dollars . 
the ministers are all aware that they cannot be excluded from the huge task of combating climate change ; it was also clear during the meeting of the hague . 
the french president will come himself presenting to you on the presidency on 12 december . 
all fifteen member states are now close to an agreement on the relaxing of closer cooperation . 
by contrast , the idea of a reference to the charter of fundamental rights in article 6 , the european parliament &apos;s position , in its recommendation of 14 november , and that we have also , as the presidency , on the table of the igc , was rejected by several member states . vigorously 
this we will have fulfilled the mandate laid down by the cologne european council and the union will have a reference is very strong , marking them clear , the rights and values which it is believed . 
at last , the nice european council will give you an overview of the priority that the french presidency attaches to economic and social issues and all the subjects on which the union can provide specific answers to the concerns of europeans . 
furthermore , on the basis of the conclusions of feira , calling for the implementation of an action plan for an information society e-europe accessible to all , the council has been working on indicators of progress . 
this debate has a number of aspects and i should like to outline three of them . firstly , the need to conclude the intergovernmental conference by the adoption of a treaty that really adds value . next , the aspect of our security policy that deals with crisis management , and finally , the need to mark out the route beyond nice . 
there is much to be done before we have a reasonable solution . 
we therefore need a new weighting of votes , according to which a majority of member states , which would represent not the majority of the population , will not be able to decide : action is that here , a democratic principle clear prevail . 
i fully agree with president prodi that we have a historic opportunity which we must not waste . 
my group , at this stage , would prefer a reweighting of votes , the double majority , but you have explained that there are other points are under consideration . 
our group strongly supports the idea of the constitutionalisation of the founding treaties . this means that the treaty reform can take place without any transparency and involvement of civil society . 
the strengthening of democracy would be necessary extension of the right of codecision by parliament . 
let us not , tomorrow , with a new multilateral agreement on investment and the new negotiations on agriculture , after the seattle conference . 
the internal policy and the policy of justice will be the subject of majority decisions , with effect from 2004 . 
mr president , nothing but the title of this item on the agenda already of the importance of article 133 evokes in the debate on the extension of qualified majority voting . 
it is particularly sad to be allowed to get into a situation where the large and small countries are put in place against each other . 
everyone must make an end of the way it is therefore clear that , in effect that the qualified majority to be available to allow the union to welcome new countries into membership . 
parliament has also demonstrated that it is a good partner when drafting the charter , and it would be particularly heartened by the prime minister blair on recognises publicly . 
if the summit in nice were to decide , for example , that the candidate countries can participate in the next european elections , that could help to put pressure on european union , so that enlargement becomes a reality . 
i will refrain from the citizens of the european areas , if we extend qualified majority voting to five areas which it will make important and which - the trade , social policy , the law , the internal affairs , the structural policy and taxation , to mention only the most important . 
we are now facing the end of the progress made and the outcomes obtained were not more than justified , but we also have to be frank : in ten months of the intergovernmental conference on these important questions , opinions were swift to come closer together , mr védrine , there has not found , so as not to mention the way in which understandings some subjects which are mentioned by the parliament in its resolution of 13 april we earmarked were not dealt with , whether of the management of the economy or the institutional implications of a common military defence , 
governments have kept in mind the urgent nature of reforms for they are blinded by their own group in the new relationship between the powers . 
mr president , i would like to remind the council and the commission , and clearly for parliament , the resolution on ‘ better law-making ’ , which we adopted on 26 october . 
i believe that all the speakers are concerned about the outcome of the european council in nice . 
finally , not only will the charter of fundamental rights is not included in the text of the treaty , but it is not even agree to make reference to rule 6 . 
if i have gathered in no way opposed to the aspirations and has , in fact , the rights of some of those countries wishing to join the community , in 2002 , it would not be , i believe , not in their interests , or in the interests of the member states to reach this stage , without that there are even ensures , firstly , an ordered transition , and that has led to a minimum of distortion in the economies of the current member states . 
everyone will have to sacrifice some of its own exceptions chéries if we want to achieve a result in nice . 
we know that a definitive solution must be found for the european elections in 2009 , that is for the legislature , which will go up , all in all , up until 2014 . 
i believe that at nice will need to be at least be able to accept the compromise position that in this parliament we are calling for , namely , the combination of the charter with article 6 ( 2 ) . 
public opinion , be it in the eu and in the candidate countries will not accept the prospect of leftovers from nice and a second igc in 2004 . 
the european parliament blames everything trébuchement yalta did . 
if we consider at this point , mr president-in-office of the council , that the french presidency has been playing a decisive role in this , we must also be noted that a few days before the summit , we are still at a standstill . 
apart from the overall picture of the forthcoming igc , a small detail , which has unfortunately important worries me . 
despite this , i would like to point out , even if this exercise is very useful , since it raises a great deal to be fighting a few questions and suggestions that i think it is a pertinent the tone of these decisions which are too negative . 
we are making every effort , if i may say so . 
they accept the principle , however , that is how it must accept the prospect , but they are deeply involved legitimate democratic and uphold they consider that the conditions are not yet been met . 
that is why it is so important to tighten up in nice , the community method , the value of the european institutions - council , parliament and commission - and the way to work together . 
such a way of proceeding is violating the rules of this parliament , constitutes a blatant lack of courtesy towards a guest eminent and could have had very serious consequences yalta did . 
i shall pass on your behalf to the president and i would ask him to investigate and take the necessary steps to prevent the again we find in our parliament to such people , who were there to disturb and threaten , and furthermore with the help of meps in europe ! 
on almost the same day , a legal personality of parliament &apos;s main cyprus , which has already visited the european parliament , would mr christou , was refused a visa turk a time when he was en route , to a tripartite meeting in istanbul between turks and greek cypriots , namely a very peaceful . 
it demonstrates that the verbal abuse is leading to physical violence . 
in 1966 , ernest lluch , his brother , and i have been lost , with some sixty staff members , from the university of barcelona lecturer by le franco régime . 
mr gorostiaga , you are a disgrace to this parliament . 
( a5-0339 / 2001 by mrs lalumière , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the establishment of a common european policy on security and defence cologne and helsinki &#91; 2000 / 2005 ( ini ) &#93; ; 
even the orders for commitments in national , for every country will be its sovereign decision to participate or not to participate in military action . 
firstly , a brief comment on one crucial problem , relations of the new european , with nato . 
similarly , we need to clarify the status of the high representative of perceiving the triangle , which exists and commissioner responsible for foreign policy . 
subsequently , permanent arrangements with third countries and with nato . 
three common strategies have been adopted since may 1999 on russia , ukraine and the mediterranean . 
it there was also a european union / ukraine summit 15 september , and the political dialogue fruitful extends now to the questions in export of conventional weapons , security and disarmament , a subject , as emphasised by the osce to be a problem with that country . 
i do not want to end this recapitulation without recalling the work done by the union on what is known as the major issues , notably in terms of human rights in the horizontal or use of overall and fast , where we still need to work for a coherent european policy in international bodies , and increase the involvement of civil society . 
i am happy to continue with this in this you exposing nowadays successes of the conference of the commitment of capacity on 20 november . 
those contributions therefore , out of a quantitative approach , to respond fully to the overall objective defined by the council . 
between now and 2003 , when the bodies set up will be able to do their work , the european union will be gradually to do certain of the petersberg tasks . capable 
we all know that the origins of the european union and the main objective of the founding fathers was to ensure that europe was torn apart in a new civil war . 
it is necessary to go on increasing the coherence and efficiency in all the pillars of the external activities of the european union . 
once again , i would refer to the media in my country , which tend sometimes à have objective and balanced , and it seems that we find it rather difficult to grasp this distinction . 
the dictatorship sur talokan has withdrawn the only route refuelling departed for valley panchir &apos;s and the plain of chamali where concentrated forces commander massud , but also a significant share of displaced people and refugees . 
the rapid reaction mechanism is meant to fulfil the petersberg tasks . 
that is why it seems a little pointless to sort out in detail , for example , the organisation of the air to the european authorities . 
the same ideas , circling around the theme of an as transparent as possible , were expressed in the cashman report , as adopted by a large majority , a fortnight ago in strasbourg . 
i would like to hear what richard about that and ask her , what should be in his opinion the role of the european parliament if this very protocol secrecy does not exist . 
it cannot continue . 
nevertheless , the &apos; republic of fear &apos; , epithet striking used over the years to come forward and name of saddam &apos;s reign of terror , is still largely underestimated in many european politicians here in the european parliament . 
i would particularly like to highlight the progress made under the auspices of the french presidency in the field of the common foreign and security policy and in the field of defence , and i wish to insist on such progress because , during the previous debate on the european council in nice , there were some reservations on the progress made in a global , mindful of this presidency . 
i know , minister , that you are sceptical about this , which you have once more to say no , as you have already made in paris in other circumstances . but this parliament , beyond all political affiliation , remains and will seek to impose this view . 
the concentration on management purely reactive crises brought the common foreign and security policy in a very bad position . 
this means that the prime objective of the council must be to combine our efforts for reducing the export of arms to unstable areas , that a fair trade policy must be put in place , that there must be aid for sustainable development and above all , support the democratic forces within the civil society . 
we also very much welcome the efforts made by mr patten , who is very popular in our countries , as did mr solana . that shows that we look at last . 
i must say that we can support many elements of the brok report , particularly the importance attached to the enlargement of the european union . 
thirdly , although i welcome the rapid reaction force , the prospect of europe must be made clear , because we shall have only one . 
mr president , today we are dealing with two reports to take place from the significant political , as the one and the other focus chiefly on the cfsp . 
we will never be philosophically neutral and not under any circumstances be confused in this concept with the military neutrality . 
however , i wonder whether it would not have been possible to tighten up the criticism and even threatening to the countries which , more than anything else , is supporting this regime , and without the help of which the taliban would , in other words on the pakistani side . 
mr president , it says under item 31 of the brok report on the field of foreign and security policy the following message : &apos; stresses the need for democratic legitimacy of russia , and the knowledge that there is a political union between russia and belarus , its chairman and his government &apos;s strong need for democratic reforms to clearly reiterated in belarus , particularly in the light of the report that the parliamentary troika of the european union , the council of europe and the osce has been presented with , on 16 october 2000 as well . &quot; minsk 
the question of the point : this concept is adopted as early as 1992 . 
he will take them in the form of approximation in stirring up trouble with the national parliaments , but what is , in any event , which is within our own hands , which represents a turning point , which we can , i believe , everyone , be pleased , is that 15 countries , which make up that union , which already have built a political reality affecting positively the reports from the world , these nations have decided to acquire the resources in fifteen to act together in those cases where violence defies our values . 
after the reports by the independent experts , the commission , at the instigation of mr kinnock , proposed a reform of its operation in a white paper . 
speaking also going on , it is also regularly recalled that , at the same time to any legislative procedure , all the budgetary decisions have to be taken within the framework of procedures and of the interinstitutional agreement of onceyearly reference . 
it gives me great satisfaction that our committee has given the findings of the bourlanges report on externalisation occasions in the letter of amendment . 
it will be followed on many other reports , and i for one will learn from these few weeks of work in consultation , i would like to see this system to be preserved for future developments . 
that is the basis of the new philosophy , the commission &apos;s management . each administrative office , will be required to take responsibility for the regularity and legality of all its actions . 
mr president , it gives me particular pleasure to be at last - and i stress the word &apos; finally &apos; – in a position to present this report this evening . 
such is the heart of what we are trying to do here . 
does the commission today in a position to fulfil its tasks and , furthermore , the political field - that are required in the treaty ? 
we shall continue in the spring onwards of the conclusions from nice and in view of the new commission proposals . 
however , we will give a vote of confidence in the commission so that it is made clear as much as possible , the scope of its proposal . 
the reform process has taken and implemented , and this is set out the progress reports of the temporary committee . 
the payment of invoices to by the european union must comply with the same practical and in the rest of the world . 
we believe that the increase in the number is too hesitant because if we look at the present tasks connected with enlargement to the east , it becomes clear that rises downsizing most important will be needed in future . 
that is why the new rules must be examined on the basis of their implementability . 
the commission , the body of the institutional , underlying the present system of the union , carries out , with all of its structure , the community policy for the setting up parliament and the council . 
we are opposed to the remaining amendments , which may be , do nothing to the report , may , we are throwing all be mad . 
consequently , the commission proposals – the white paper , promoted by commissioner kinnock , have the support of our political group . 
late payments are accumulating and obstacles are well known . 
we have all seen the effect of paralysis which is concerned , or rather , the effect of paralysis , total , which must not only led to the culture of fear in the committee . i refer to the services and public servants . 
mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , i shall be brief , but before we continue , i should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs . 
this debate gives me an opportunity to give a picture of the progress that the latest in the area of implementation of our strategy for modernising and further preparation improvements future improvements we have identified eight months in our strategy . 
if i had more time , i would of course be delighted to address the issues raised , and i am sure that an opportunity . 
other elements have been in the process of design , others still remain to be supported and implemented by the decisions of parliament and the council . 
the commission must be able to meet the deadlines for payments and this is included among its objectives . 
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. 
we will see the next year when the evaluation we requested on the results of the reform we shall be presented . 
the part of this one in the aid was , thirty years ago , international community , by 7 % , it is of a 17 % today . 
we want to give them clearer objectives . 
the commission must also ensure that this takes place at international level . 
in accordance with this report is concerned , poverty and under-development continue to make up lost ground and many people are still unable to carry out their inalienable right to live in dignity . 
the process of implementing the decision taken in may by the commission on the reform of external relations is progressing well . 
it is also necessary to ensure that programmes can , in the future , to be easily administered by our delegations and made more accessible to our partners . 
( a5-0342 / 2001 ) by mr ortuondo larrea , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 94 / 57 / ec of the council laying down rules and common standards for the bodies entitled to be carried out the inspection and the visit of the vessels and activities relevant administrations maritime ( com ( 2000 ) 0142 c5-0175 - 2000 / 0066 ( cod / 2000 97 ) ) 
indeed , on the basis of proposals we made in february , the european commission &apos;s proposals are with all speed . 
all these proposals relate to the very essence of the regulations on maritime transport , and i would like to remind you that , in addition to the three proposals that have to be debated here today , the erika package , like mr gayssot else said , ii will be , for its part , been discussing this next week , and 
there has been since then , sadly , there are some other disasters at sea , as we know only too well . 
thirdly , we state , and we are not , the only ones to do so , if a vessel hazardous should be detained only then to be allowed to go back into the sea . 
i should like to add that the commission &apos; s initiative to present this position is important , because it has played such an extent as a sword of damocles , like , effective pressure on the imo in order to succeed . 
the other hand , of inspections will be imposed when the deadline is met by tax inspectors exclusive and specialised , since we cannot have any connection with the ship owner , and that it does not have control over the classification of the vessel . 
furthermore , although the direct dumping of materials to manufacturers , including the dumping of munitions servicemen considered as obsolete , is largely a practice which has been abandoned by member states , these weapons and materials industrialists still represent a real threat to the fishing industry and in some cases with a threat to security of men . 
the cooperation that includes the exchanges of information and the summary of places from dumping of munitions . 
strong action must be conducted on the issue of flags of convenience and , for example , the so-called sky futuna for france , and against the ships who beat up , over the space of 36 months before adopting these directives , the flag of the state , as it stands in the table of assets and delays in excess of the average , published in the annual report on the paris memorandum in heading blacklist yalta did . 
well then , please accept this proposal . 
i therefore ask you , in turn , like to conclude this issue as quickly as possible in the council . 
but if the state flag remains in default , the port state must be given more responsibility . 
eight thousand sur ninety thousand boats that are sailing the seas worldwide are below the standards of safety and 4000 transport dangerous goods . 
safety at sea , many european players is emphasised , is largely the result of deregulation and the practices of convenience . 
how will we be able , in the midst of a french presidency of the union , to explain to our citizens that the european parliament has taken out the necessary measures for incentives and deterrents financial which they were proposed to accelerate the transition to double hulls . 
concerning the responsibilities of the port state , we cannot continue to be complacent in the task of the port authorities . 
i know that this is the text that the council is able to put up with , but are maximal are not going to contribute to its adoption in the hope that it will be improved at second reading . if we are not voting against because we acknowledge the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur , mr ortuondo , who has been taken over by a few compromise amendments show us the way to go at the next reading . 
we are concerned it is first of all of the erika , but at the same time , a tanker sank elsewhere off turkey to be precise . 
i now have a few brief comments about the plane monocoques yalta did . 
we have the political and economic resources to implement to ensure respect for our choices . 
we need a complete overview of the responsibility of all players . 
this also concerns specifications double-hull ships . 
we might by then managed to avert a catastrophe . 
this , i believe , is the balance can be reached on the basis of the commission &apos;s proposals and the imo , and also of the reports under discussion for which the members who are the perpetrators far deserve to be congratulated . 
the proof is that the measures adopted at international level to improve safety and reduce pollution adventitious have had a success . 
the commitment of the classification societies must be assessed with the aid of common standards : number of accidents , of incidents or detentions of ships inspected and certified causing pollution 
when the ievoli sun sank the ship was young , in relative terms , double-hulled crews est community-spirited , and the flag of italy . 
but most importantly , this is the will is fierce and we should be working together to change the system of rules , which is in the maritime transport in order to reduce the insecurity of shipping . 
most of the amendments are focused on the refusal proposed that access to waters of the community . 
many of them . this represents are outside the port state control or are already covered by this directive or by another directive . 
for reasons that are similar , the commission cannot agree with the new amendment no 22 , which refers to the important subject of the safety of shipping , but it has no place in the regulations being proposed . 
i share the concerns of parliament , which underlines the fact that an owner of vessels should be able to exert any influence on society of classification . unearthly 
secondly , as part of our proposal erika ιι in monitoring the maritime industry , the member states will have an obligation to intervene , even on the open sea , in such cases ; 
mr poos , you wish to speak on the debate ? 
( parliament approved the commission proposal ) 
we withdraw our resolution because it has been reproduced quasi fully and in the joint resolution , literally by both the president of the major political groups . subscribed 
the first part is much in an oral amendment , but the second part relates to a split vote that i cannot accept , because this amendment was not tabled in time . 
report ( a5-0328 / 2001 ) by mr lamassoure , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the white paper on reform of the commission ( the aspects of constitutional affairs committee ) ( com ( 2000 ) 200 - c5-0448 / 2000 - 2000 / 2218 ( cos ) ) 
watts report ( a5-0343 / 2001 ) 
the monitoring of all commercial shipping must be carried out by a service public-étatique with staffed well-trained and of the necessary technological equipment with the active participation of the trade unions of seafarers . 
i voted in favour of the report by mr watts , which is aimed at increasing the quality and the frequency of inspections at ports of member states of the european union . 
if we should have thought about it earlier , if mr hatzidakis , had been here before , in recent years , it would have proposed a double hull requirement for ships , and we would have saved them from many disasters . 
the risk of collisions maritime there that is so great that , without a monitoring and control the risk of accidents additional sea ne ceasing probably increase . 
one has to stop at the commission proposal . 
for the erika , the industries of local fisheries and aquaculture sectors have suffered the full force of the and it is important not only to look upon the tragic consequences in the days immediately following the disaster , but also that of apparent look ahead and take into account the detrimental effects long-term of oil pollution . 
the baltic is an internal sea very fragile , which is already heavily contaminated by emissions of the industry , waste water and in agriculture . 
furthermore , the training of inspectors in these societies , varies from one country to another . 
but the best thing would be monitoring harmonised becomes directly the responsibility of the authorities . 
we are rejecting the generalised extension of qualified majority voting , be accompanied by an extension is parallel to codecision and the abolition of the compromise reached in luxembourg . 
upon assessment of the common foreign and security policy , we are in agreement with the who has been given the treatment of the prevailing crisis . 
we expressed during the whole of the intergovernmental conference , our opposition to the idea that is endorsed on several occasions by a majority of members of this amendment is to extend significantly the agenda . we have also been reports of this position to do at all vote on the motions for resolutions tabled in connection with this . 
it must be made clear the importance of the social agenda in order for it being set up soon . 
with regard to extending the use of qualified majority voting , i do not believe that this is of a sensible proposal , given that she would overlap with the member states &apos; right to take a decision in due course on the communitisation or non-communautarisation policy . 
the advocates of liberal europe , not only in this connection , we should not extend the scope of that poverty peoples already shackled by poverty , but they are imposing on this occasion , a political project and formalise a pole of rich countries who will watch a european market to be enlarged . 
parliament has just voted a resolution on the nice summit with the following characteristics : 
our debates , in this house are more at monologues successive ppc and real trade . 
i am opposed to the development of a common defence policy and the installation of a council of ministers for defence . 
we think that this transformation of the delegations of the commission by delegations of the european community would be likely to mislead the conflicts of interest with the national diplomatic delegations in our various countries . 
it is therefore clear that this is one of the road to a quest for harmonisation , when it is desired , timely and effective , among some decisions that are still fundamentally according exclusive prerogative of those at a national , and thereby help to strengthen the influence of the action of european diplomacy , and not by means of imposing ideals structural totally ineffective . 
the five honourable members . ( da ) in the european parliament have today voted in favour of the lalumière report on a common policy on security and defence , because we are in favour of strengthening its capacity for action of the european union member states and , at the same time , to that of nato . 
we take issue especially now against this policy of military imperialist that there is within this chamber on a consensus that is stated on the subject , an approval , and support for this policy from displayed immense majority of groups , the extreme right to the greens and to the pse . 
paragraph 49 is planning to make the member states which do not want to or not participating in a mission and to take both sides and then to finance it . nevertheless 
the rapporteur lists many reasons for one intervention outside the territory . one of these is the indignation justified have about the ethnic conflict in regions outside the union . 
furthermore , we have objections specific about a lot of paragraphs , such as : 
such a breach with nato that are simply to close one step closer to europe itself is far from the grand speeches which have followed the fall of the wall . 
i refuse , however , the capacity of interpreter of my vote to be the proof that i am opposed to the participation of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts . 
: the only positive aspects of this report are all well and you are asking for a &apos; european definition of the work in the home was &apos; and a &quot; limitation clear d the maximum number of hours worked . 
naturally , this is a situation in an almost unique strategically important , when i read all the proposals in favour of the derogations that are listed in the report . 
income tax and social security contributions and vat bring price hourly levels that practically none household in lower-income categories on the standard is only prepared to pay . 
. ( nl ) on the work of women has a long history of the bad payments and of poor working conditions , legal position that is inimical and intimidation of sex . 
this abdication of responsibility , an outcome of a long putrefied , must not , however , make us forget that the &quot; commission &quot; bore of responsibilities than the one before him succéda yalta did . 
but i have , above all , voted in favour because i wish to , and i do in this house - that when an investigation into the accounts , which is to say how that money is spent by the commission , without dealing not just to the control of the figures – four plus four equalled eight eight longer eight equalled sixteen sixteen longer sixteen equalled 32 thirty-two longer thirty-two equalled 64 – but control also whether this expenditure has been a very useful for europe , if they really have achieved the objectives that they seeking to achieve . 
similarly , the lack of transparency and measures of convenience must disappear in the area of recruitment , particularly with regard to the posts temporary . 
. british conservative meps will vote against the report because of their opposition to so often repeated in the extension of qualified majority voting and the proposal to include the report on fundamental rights in the treaty . 
adjournment of the session 
this is what i had been said , but i will go to new , more up-to-date and i will pass us by your message . 
this is the position adopted by our group . 
madam president , the nice summit is especially important . 
with regard to the considerations on the substance , let me give just one example . 
we believe that this report must be thorough and , therefore , call upon to debate and vote on it in january . 
yet , its presence is very important in this report , is partly why it is of great interest and of which their success depends to a greater part of the commission . 
parliament &apos;s rules of procedure say that it is not meant to smoke in certain places , amongst which the house . 
of the adaptation of the draft directive are needed , they are now presented . 
let us hope that we can do that from now on . 
if that does not happen again that the responsibility will be at least clear and well defined . 
but , ladies and gentlemen , if you were really aware of the problem out tobacco vous exigeriez the banning of this drug , as you continue to keep up that of other substances , and yet much less . quantitatively 
also , amendment no 2 on carbon monoxide is a particularly important . 
history teaches us that it is dangerous to assume the objective - which is so great and si virtuous that it may be - exceeds the rules . 
mr president , i want to serve the workers in this sector . 
and , although i was not here , it is clear that my vote was along those lines . 
consequently , my concern , at the moment , is not so much on the problems of health , which are of course , are important and extensive , that on the restriction associated our acceptance of this extremely restrictive interpretation of the legislative power from the european parliament . 
mr president , if it is truly a law on the success of the second reading , it will lead to a restriction on freedom of the industry on the one hand and greater protection of public health . 
the results of research in this area are so clear that we cannot , as european legislators , do not keep up with these councils . 
because of the decision of the court of justice , the council adopted a further condemnation of this position - and this time by a large majority . 
we would also have had to be stopped . 
the power of large tobacco industry is all too evident . 
yet , and this is a disgrace to the european union , we call on our taxpayers to subsidise the cultivation of this awful substance to the tune of over eur 1 billion per year . 
the procedure of the tests is ineffective . 
this directive was introduced in order to take account of the conclusions of the valverde lópez report for 1997 by the european parliament , which was also mentioned many elements to be appointed under the present text , and called for a commission proposal . 
that is why the need to regulate , in the interests of consumers – is clear . 
in this connection , let me say that , in terms of international rules and community , there is no exception for the words of the measures taken to protecting public health , and more particularly here , where the effects on the behaviour of all smokers are so considerable . 
this relates to the issue of access to goods , especially when the distribution companies are located in places without supervision . 
summer time 
we also face other problems that we would like to consider , like that of energy consumption and the health and safety , because they have report to summer-time ; but the argument which the strongest is still no doubt that we want to give the opportunity for the new member states to comply with our provisions . 
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i note once again that the advantages and disadvantages of summertime are giving rise to discussions in greater depth . 
our group believes that the proposal which has just been made is a good one ; he is right behind it and is the view that further amendments are not necessary . 
another problem , there is , as agriculture , in the autumn , during political battages it indicates that rainfall in the morning is likely to have disappeared . surprisingly , the very nature does not adhere to the directive . 
as regards the amendments which have been tabled , the commission has agreed with amendments nos 3 and 4 , whose aim is to make the system more transparent and to insist on the precautionary principle . 
according to the european parliament , the compromises on which we accepted a considerable improvement in the council &apos;s common position . 
children should be given of the medicines that have only been tested on adults , which meant that children are badly treated . 
it can help improve clinical research in europe and therefore the welfare of the millions of patients . 
this compromise , which can of course still be surpassed by each member state lays down a minimum threshold , which is aimed at preventing the appearance in the european union of a kind of dumping ethics which would provide the facility to a member state , but not to others , to carry out research on persons incapable of giving their informed consent . 
finally , and in this connection i should like to express my disappointment that this provision has not integrated in the compromise proposals from the council , i believe the investigateur main on the conduct of clinical trials , with responsibility must be a doctor . because the only things that doctors have knowledge and experience which will allow them to assess the benefits and to rectify the undesirable effects and risks in the course of these tests . 
the next item is the report ( a5-0377 / 2001 ) by mr trakatellis , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a decision of the european parliament and the council some of the programmes of action community extending the public health , which were accepted by the decisions 645 candidates / 96 / ec , 646 / 96 / ec , 647 / 96 / ec , 102 / 97 / ec , 1400 / 97 / ec and 1296 / 1999 / ec and modifying these decisions . &#91; com ( 2000 ) 0448 - c5-0400 / 2000 - 2000 / 0192 ( cod ) ) . 
perhaps , i would add , do we have opened a new method of operation in the field of codecision . 
it is also a problem about which we believe that we note the weakness of the orientation of the european union , the council and the commission which , together with budgetary cuts , for not achieving the self-imposed ceiling of 1.27 % currently allowed under the existing rules , means that action such as this is permitted whereas coordination between the various member states is proving more and more important . 
this is an area which can be taken into account in the context of the new community programme for public health which is due to begin shortly . 
the text we are adopting today on the extension to six programs public-health reflects the agreements which are informal between institutions . 
all these factors , operating independently or a joint basis , which multiplies their effect , mean that every day , naturally , the millions of people cross the borders of their country of residence and move towards countries of the european union , to live there , working , studying or merely y travel . 
the european union cannot accept that they receive different treatment depending on the member states in which they have been victims of the offence or according to nationality . 
we should therefore consider whether it is reasonable to approve this draft . 
indeed , we cannot seriously speak of a europe of citizens in isolation from the rights of victims . 
the liberal group feels that a very good report has come out of the debates in committee , and will therefore support the amendments by the commission when we vote . 
compensation for victims must come first , the payment of fines and excessive costs , of justice on the state . 
i welcome the proposal from portugal to improve the basis of the victims in the criminal proceedings , even though i have every respect for the viewpoints legal considerations that have been outlined by mr lehne . 
who would want to participate , especially by the vote , to a democracy which would leave aside the problems ? 
several amendments refer to the official languages of the european union , providing for the right for the victims of the communication in one of these languages . 
as i said before , the commission , continuing the follow-up to its communication of 14 july 1999 , is working towards the adoption of specific measures to assist the victims , particularly through the support it on to the european forum of care services envisaged victims . 
we take note of it . 
i believe that the institutions , and in this case the commission , should work with more serious for that the proposals to this house in time and for , and delivered to being able , at the rapporteur &apos; , to examine the commission &apos;s proposal to table the amendments , have a debate in committee , and then we can discuss in plenary . we are being asked to do everything in one plenary session , which is not possible . 
we did not care of the budgetary objectives to which we submitted our policy . 
the constantly campaigned most tormented throughout the budgetary procedure , so it was in the financing of our external action . 
to what is happening in the case or what i will follow what is needed , as general rapporteur of parliament and the council presidency , which will return to belgium in the second half of next year and wish , already a great pleasure in the negotiations . 
i would also like to state clearly that we have in this parliament a number of vacant posts which , year after year , enables savings amounting to tens of millions of euros , so that we must ask ourselves if we establish more our budget properly . 
another reason for tackling this subject on its knees , perhaps owing to the attitude of certain members of this house who seem to know whether to want to be subject to are the instructions from the council . blindly 
the first point of agreement between the council and parliament concerns the external action , i.e. category 4 of the budget , for which our institutions , a common goal , i.e. shared reconnoitring substantial funding , for the european regions in the balkans in 2001 , taking account of recent developments in the political situation in serbia , and this without the other geographical external action six priority areas have to pay for it . 
finally , an agreement was reached on 23 november , he has produced on an increase in payment appropriations for the budget for 2001 , which is restricted to 3.5 % over the budget 2000 . 
similarly , it is in a manner consistent with this interinstitutional agreement that the council has left substantial margins under the ceilings on financial forecasts in 1999 , in particular for categories 3 , internal policies - and on heading 4 - external actions . 
i hope that it can act quickly . 
the court has recently confirmed in a special relationship - something that has been reached this target , that the resources the cohesion fund are being properly used . 
with regard to specific cases of application that we have seen during the past two years , i.e. kosovo or serbia , mobilising the flexibility instrument in enabling us to finance expenditure exceptional by making an effort of the ordinary . 
whereas the us companies perceive three times that amount of aid and that a country , of course , such as turkey is spending more than 10 % of the state budget to agriculture and horticulture in mind , this means that europe wants to achieve everything sans nothing pay . 
the emphasis is on what goes out rather than the goes in . 
the fish , commissioner , is a fundamental part of any healthy diet , balanced and which is rich in protein . 
we think it is absolutely essential that we bear in mind that this progress report is designed to restore the confidence of our citizens in the functioning of the european union institutions . 
after a long period of conflict and war , during which our continent was acting perfectly resolved , it is important that the balkan people should know this : when it comes to implement the reconstruction work , they can also count on us . 
it will damage the interinstitutional agreement . i have to tell you that next year we will examine it in detail if we can still accept that . 
with the commitment of the standing of the flexibility reserve , then that is the transparency of the budget which is suffering , and in the long term , this will lead to a loss of credibility . 
i stand here before you , who represent the peoples of europe , to present a matter of priority the results of the intergovernmental conference on the reforms of the institutions . 
the number of areas in which the vote will be carried out by qualified majority vote was , i know , that is seen by the parliament as a priority of these negotiations . 
i note too that the igc has meant that an extension of powers and scope of the european parliament . 
the last six months , it is also in the area of growth and jobs that europe has progressed . 
two months ago , the ministers for education adopted an action plan for mobility , a plan of 42 measures , and we agreed to receive substantial amount of eur 400 million for the programme which is so important for the media plus cinema and audiovisual sector , and whom , as you know , the whole profession expectations 
it is now up to the swedish presidency - for which i would remind you that the environment is one of the priorities too - to bring the second package of proposals , which includes the establishment of a european maritime safety agency . 
ec military arm , the european union will use it in complete harmony with the machinery to nato and , if necessary , with the support of those . 
france had gone before , that in fact been paying particular attention . 
furthermore , in your speech at the beginning of the summit , you said that the parliament with the success of nice not only quantitatively deems but also in terms of quality . 
in response to this desire of citizens , we asked for the double majority , which is the only instrument that is objective , comprehensible and which is largely shared by the small and large member states . 
madam president , mr president-in-office of the european council , president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , the summit has finally reached an outcome . 
how can the union made its decision on a constitutional nature , in passing three sleepless nights victims of this disaster ? 
madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , president of the commission , i pick up the background , with regard to a famous doctor french entitled self-persuasion and has formulated a method - autosuggestion , founded on the principle of establishing autosuggestion and private acquisition autoconviction yalta did . 
that apart , what a cruel demonstration of the crisis , not just for our institutions but at a deeper crisis of identity in the construction of europe in the face of the issues involved trojan faced by the european union pact ! 
modern technology is fort consummate simple one ; repel shelved always bear the burden of proof , and take decisions that are devoid of content , or of applicability to places further afield and ultimately to be presenting the just like in a remarkable success . 
it too , are not happy with just about all the world , starting with the small countries . 
the interests and of differences in the council would have avoided the debates on the number of commissioners which cling each state . 
thank you , mr hager is correct . 
that is where we have to be a contradiction ... 
before the vote on amendment no 22 : 
thus , the use on children is covered at times of revenue , so it is necessary to encourage individual empirical representations to the pharmaceutical companies , the development of products which are specifically designed for children and their ills so that the doses and forms pharmaceutical are tailored to their own systems . 
in practice , the period for the summer has turned into the period of normality . 
but when i came back from italy , mr newens , mr fatuzzo , who talked to me has said , &quot; mr fatuzzo , if we are to have a vacancier new identity cards and a new licence document , i had to make that statement to the police and the carabinieri italians . 
madam president , i wholeheartedly support this report on improving the protection of victims of crime , which once again demonstrates the eu &apos;s commitment to combating crime and in protecting our citizens . 
according to my sources , it needs to be extradited to russia . 
results hopeless to parliament : the refusal to allow broaden seriously deliberations by majority , the denial of parliament to codecision . i say this in passing , the establishment of the composition sans for parliament to be shocking even consulted about the composition . 
the decisions concerning the vote on the council and the seats in parliament should have been taken casino cannes and no to the acropolis of nice , with mr chirac , in the role of croupier en . 
it seems that the negotiators swedes have claimed several main goal is to please the large states to fight to retain their own influence to bear . 
the nice treaty contains a number of important measures towards a european union as an elite , and also at several measures for the distance between the union of democracies and the citizens . 
that is why , in future , to make progress on this continent , we must have a method , states that an intergovernmental conference was based on a convention , in which the members of parliament , and not the authorities , have the last word . 
that is our commitment , president prodi , commissioner barnier . 
as regards the european parliament , only the commission has stood up for the legitimacy , which i thank president prodi and commissioner barnier . they were , unfortunately on their own , what is in the compromise at the end . 
it was not in agreement that a bad agreement &apos; , who asked the french presidency , before the nice summit , and this morning , if i understood correctly , we were told &apos; better a bad agreement that no agreement at all . &quot; 
but the failure of historic importance of nice is that , behind the decisions , it is a lack of vision for a union consisting of 27 states . 
the claim of the national governments to give us a constitution to europe has now finally collapsed . the hope that the heads of state and government to consider themselves to the defenders of the idea of european unification has definitely been a failure . 
the gaps old ones were not realised , and some others have been added 
mr president , i would first like to associate myself , i , too , in the praise you have just made to mr brok and mr tsatsos . 
i would like to begin again merely some of the critics , or of the lessons that i have heard , on occasion . 
i honestly believe that the system in that way have i e not pretend that it is clear and readable – is a balanced system . 
that is what i will refer to this debate , the presidency , and also of the intergovernmental conference . 
with regard to the treaty of nice , there is little to say , because we have not yet the european council conclusions and , consequently , we will not be able to add anything until we shall see them do not . 
furthermore , the treaty is a mixture of loose ends not satisfactory and well , in terms not satisfactory , but better than ‘ business as usual , i assume that , at least as regards the extension of qualified majority voting , the extension of the codecision procedure for the european parliament and the provisions on closer cooperation . 
there is the fact that the european parliament has no part in the context of reinforced cooperation , when some of the leaders of different national parties - including that of the labour party in his speech in warsaw – had been promised that there are even put forward at any reform of the structural funds would not proceed actual before 2013 . 
mr president , president of the commission , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , from the winners and losers of nice , but europe , has certainly not in the ranks of the winners , nor will the democratic and transparent . 
things cannot be allowed to happen . 
the outermost regions deserve better , and parliament will continue , with the aid with which i am sure that commissioner barnier , for us to work flat out for their right to take their rightful place within the union . 
&quot; we have managed to keep things in hand &apos; or &quot; we have succeeded in blocking decisions european-led &apos; then racontent-ils into their own countries . 
this is regrettable , and the very encouraging sign is that the european commission has made it was later found confidence . 
the debate is closed . 
mr president , i would first of all that it be noted that the budget of this year has been due , above all to the work of all the members of the commission and of course , that the work of the president , mr wynn , who has managed the various situations that we have experienced wisely -including les tense situations . 
the member states at that time were not concerned their citizens and widening , spain and portugal , has come to be accompanied by a sizeable mobilization of resources . 
the approval of a supplementary and amending budget is essential , and , therefore , the potential savings descend at again in a manner consistent , but also in its entirety . 
there was no more of a qualified majority in this parliament to come back to article 272 . 
then , when i found that there was no debate about article 25 of the iia , i was rather disappointed , and that word is weak . 
however , the european parliament cannot continually adjustments to its commitments in external affairs . 
we are using to 1.06 % of gross national product of member states , which also creates the more important than ever before , and the more so than was foreseen in berlin , a little less than two years . 
in the field of environment policy , we cannot go into the establishment of minimum rules , applied to an abandonment of confined spaces , useful if they outlined , but also on the funding will be constantly and a-critique may institutions , whose work does not work particularly noteworthy , as is the case , for example , in my opinion , to the european environment agency in copenhagen . 
firstly , regarding the structure of the 2001 budget : it has been said that the agriculture budget has increased heed . 
i think it is a good thing to have been able to activate all the same the flexibility instrument and provide the necessary aid to serbia , even though i fully agree with you that we should get round to the situation in a flexible instrument across europe , through the various itinerant countries and regions , and whenever the need arises , if used must not become a strategic plan . 
i expect a more in-depth debate in this house is taking place next month as part of the topical and urgent debate and i am proposing that only a limited extent in this debate in the resolutions . 
several areas can be defined in which the areas of agreement can be found , for example in the balkans , in the caucasus and central asia . 
this resource passes well , however , often in the places in the grip to major conflicts . 
it underlines the importance of the strategy with russia and the importance of your report , mr oostlander . 
energy policy , which is related to the policy of the major powers , is an important area of cooperation . one example is the problem of the are transporting oil and gas from east to west . 
a member of my party , a radical militant journalist , was murdered a few weeks ago in tbilisi , town , on a mandate from the russian forces . 
it proposes , for the northern dimension , a budget heading and defends an overall increase in aid for russia . 
as of this interest , the union has developed its own areas of activity in many areas , both in its common strategy towards russia and in the other documents . 
in the explanatory statement , you read in item jj &quot; whereas , russia constitution-building with belarus , a political union , it is important for the democratic legitimacy of russia , that president putin and the russian government to make clear and unequivocal stand the absolute need to reform and progress of democracy in belarus , in view of amongst other things the report that was submitted in minsk on 16 october 2000 , by the parliamentary troika of the european union , the council of europe and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) . 
the widespread &apos; nordic dimension is receiving from this proposal , an appropriation own budget , which is a very important indeed . as for myself , i propose that the energy issues are to become the driving force of this important project . 
other areas where we are trying to support the effort of cooperation between the european union in relation to russia are the rule of law and the consolidation of democracy , civil society , the regional and cross-border cooperation twinning , and , above all , the initiative , which several members have talked about . nida 
a brief word on kaliningrad . tropospheric pca offer us an institutional framework for our dialogue with russia in matters of commerce , on visas and long-term health disorders ex-commuters . 
by applying of requirements which are more favourable in the field of visas for the inhabitants of secessionist regions or by en exempting completely , at last , you would support , the legitimacy of their regimes . 
the question was : there have been cases where this directive has not been followed up . if gmos have been bandied about in the environment . 
i fear that we adopt it at that , within a substantive debate that we have no time to deal with here . 
the council remains deeply concerned about the situation in chechnya , the violence continues , the humanitarian situation remains extremely worrying for the inclusion of the winter . 
the french presidency , can she relay contacting mr nielson , calling for it thors was with some haste to travel very rapidly in chechnya ? 
one i have given is not , because you see is that the house is certainly not going to be full . 
mr president , i believe that the question is sufficiently precise . 
you are right that combating fraud is never sufficiently developed . 
nevertheless , i think the proposal presented by the french presidency is totally unacceptable , and it did in fact only one aim : to maintain the highest number of asylum seekers outside of the eu , which in essence , threatens to result in an increase in illegal immigration . 
last month , when i asked a supplementary question during question time . this fact president-in-office had wellnigh dodged saying : ‘ i can only repeat my earlier answer , &quot; and he then re-read his response . 
i can assure the members who have helped me so that the council will take account of their interviewed observations . 
the council , for all these decisions , is attempting to restore consumer confidence in the european union . 
you know , we are acting at all times in the state of knowledge , and therefore i cannot entirely be doing irate that analysis . 
these are the initiatives that the council has taken or intends to take towards the algerian authorities . 
with regard to your second question , the council fully shares the view of the secretary-general of the united nations to be involved in this exercise , in all the institutions in question and of experts , or bodies research or academic institutions who have the kind of interest to the question of children . 
the presidency is very pleased with this outcome , which marks an important step in implementing the pre-accession strategy turkish defined last year in helsinki . 
the guarantees which the author of this question refers may arise from the right of every accused to defend itself itself or of having the assistance of a defender of his choice and , if we cannot afford to pay a supporter , they can be assisted by a lawyer to office if gratuitously the interests of justice so dictates , conditioning by policies gratuitously d an interpreter , if it does not understand or does not speak the language used off hearings and of being judged within a reasonable period of time , or released during the procedure . 
thus , as claimed by the council in a previous reply , the programme of mutual recognition must be nothing less than make any improvements in the field of fundamental rights . 
the decision to send out an operation would take , in principle , the form of a joint action . 
the honourable member &apos;s question concerns the opinions expressed informally by the president of the commission . 
mr president , it gives me great satisfaction that i am presenting today , at the plenary of the european parliament a report on the stabilisation and association of croatia , with the european union . 
the european union has just made on at the zagreb summit on 24 november . 
i do not see any contre-indication acquainted with the development of relationships between the european union and croatia and the individual countries in the balkans and to develop at the same time a regional cooperation , on the other . 
the issue must be subject to different conditions , namely that access to asylum croatia must fulfil legal international standards and be held under humane conditions . 
there is , unfortunately , also had some serious jump at the durban recapture yalta did . 
we are hoping to substantial progress to be made in these negotiations and to be able to be concluded soon . 
i know that the croatian government is keen that the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process are judged on an individual basis , depending on their own merits . 
certainly , in many respects , the hardest remains to be done , but i have no doubt the ability of people in that country to meet the challenge , to tread the difficult path of reform , the path that is open to them and which leads to europe . 
the problem that the government is facing is very evident in the regions which , under the khmer suharto were used - as areas of land on migration in order to tackle the problem of overpopulation and exploited like territories captured by the adfl . 
the eu should do likewise . 
our main concerns lie and we expect a response from the european commission to these developments . 
but the level of the cooperation should take into account the actual progress made by the country in the resolution of regional problems and the methods being developed , respect for human rights and also the cooperation that the country is to a positive development of the process of independence of east timor , particularly in relation to the rules on issues that faces the refugees in west timor , when assessing and condemning the members of the militias which are guilty of criminal activities and which have murdered recently three officials of the united nations . 
the revolution in the country and the way in which it found itself , still remain the bedrock of guarded optimism . 
admittedly , the soldiers , have less influence , but they always have the odds . 
mrs maij-weggen , has produced an excellent report , and i would like , therefore , like when i say that europe must do everything in its power to support the country on the road to democracy , but it is up to the indonesians themselves that it is up to get rid of the regime suharto . 
it mentions , in fact , by name , very frankly , the forces opposed to the essentials and demanding processes of reform . 
any external action other than support for democratisation and the rule of law can only be seen as counterproductive and inflammatory all round . 
it goes without saying that since then , there do did not end there , and 
only two years ago , then it was still being ruled by an authoritarian leader who is supported by armed forces . 
the debate is closed . 
this one has been partly out of date and the summit in nice is no change to the situation . 
nevertheless , there are differing views on how this human rights protection can be guaranteed . 
mr president , i can be brief because this is not the first discussion on this subject . 
we do not believe that increased solutions at community level can improve the fight against crime in that our efforts will be characterised by all the more so because of indifference , of carelessness and de secretiveness administrations overall eu yalta did . 
in my view , the european public prosecutor is merely a first step along the path to corpus juris , a body that is common law for the whole of europe . 
we are wasting enormous sums of money which is quite simply because they are not perceived by the member states . 
you know , the commission would have preferred that olaf be created as a government totally independent . 
we must not forget that this is the reservations of parliament to give its assent to the way that taxpayers &apos; money had been spent , in 1996 , which triggered the fall of the commission in 1999 . 
we depend upon the court , which provides us with the weapons with which draw on areas of darkness . 
. ( fr ) we doing our utmost to monitor it properly . the commission and the member states , and this report is an effort in this direction . 
mr president , may i begin by welcoming the opportunity of this initiative and the speed with which our rapporteur mrs eluned morgan has carried it out . 
we must be able to judge whether the situation is improving or exacerbated . 
indeed , the commission retains always read the information and failed to answer some questions , in particular as regards the fléchard case . 
i am sure the house would wish her all hoping and praying for success in this , although i fear , that ‘ discharge &quot; and &quot; procedure &quot; are amongst the first words proposals than issue an opinion baby . 
i would respond also to mrs stauner , who has raised some of the specific questions that this agreement stipulates that requests of confidential information to be asked or transferred to the commission by the president of the committee . 
once again , congratulations on your report . 
seen as part of a directive that are their shareholders must be given a fair price about as much of an effect except to say that an apple when it is mature graves de l tree . 
for this reason i can only invite the house to approve the compromise amendments tabled by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
in order to be effective , valuable and in the public interest , such a directive should : first , to avoid the direct involvement of the courts in him preferring a regulatory body endowed with a very vast discretion under the authority of the law ; secondly , our own rules on jurisdiction and clarify , for that would use them ; and thirdly , make it clear what is meant by fair price and to set thresholds appropriate ; fourthly , to see to it that the direction being rival prevent wrongly shareholders to taking decisions which they believe they must take on the future of the society in which they hold . 
it is true that the regulation of the european parliament does not offer this option , when making those discussions will be a mere , pure deaf ears . 
thirdly , clear : the lack of clarity is particularly evident in the debate on the court of law , an area in which i have some experience . 
the european institutions openly disregarded of redundancies and closures of companies caused by almost all of the takeovers or mergers of undertakings . 
furthermore , if we open the door on defensive measures , mr president , perhaps more difficult , the restructuring of the european markets , particularly the protection of small shareholders . 
neither the community law or the national legislation of several member states have at the moment , a compulsory system under the laws on acquisition of undertakings . 
mr president , i would like to thank parliament for the attention it devotes to the proposal , together with the committee on legal affairs , in particular the rapporteur - as mr lehne - , for the work they have done . 
the first one is in fact only the owners and the second point relates to only about the supervisory authority . 
the third part is not acceptable to the same reasons as those that apply to all the amendments that the so-called &apos; social &apos; . 
this is an unacceptable situation on the european market , as being incompatible with the requirements of the internal market . 
there has been some misunderstanding on the basis , because we believe that the use of corporations collective management will be compulsory , as is currently the case in austria . 
the socialist group has thus been that parliament may déconsidère &apos;t by accepting proposals which ridiculisent votes that took place in the first reading . 
the opinions on the resale right ne tread no border in the political groups . it is up to the member state level . 
this is intellectual property against the principle of retaliation . 
in any event , in the name of what should we impose a tax on the resale of the table , and does not do the same , for the benefit of the manufacturer or the generalised lindh , for a car or a toeing sold at second hand ? 
for these same reasons . amendment no 4 and the part of amendment no 7 which is linked to this issue must also be rejected . 
discussions about a very important subject at a time when we do not yet have in our own mother tongue of the amendments tabled at the last minute , and amendments before the committee that i think is quite impossible . 
this should therefore be an exception , if we hold a debate without a copy of the amendments . 
we have agreed within the commission to keep up the issue of special services such as that for which was endorsed by the directive no 67 / 97 . 
madam president , i could also make a lot of things , but i will now confine myself to saying that there have rarely been such a political consensus between the various committees of this parliament called upon to give their opinion on a problem . 
of this is our responsibility . 
however , my group shares the view that we must take care of course , the same time , as a community and as member states to define a framework for a universal service . 
and yet , we are supposed to adhere to the commission &apos;s proposals that have not even have access to these studies . 
we are often simply here to represent the citizens of europe . 
. ( fr ) we emboîtons the step to the monopolies . 
furthermore , there is reference to the 1997 directive . 
i shall be very clear on one particular point . 
while the electronic communications that we in this ; it , the former monopolies state-run remain chiefly turned to the interior . 
there is a link between all these things . 
i give my support to the limit set at 150 grams for reasons of caution . 
i am not an adversary a priori of the market or liberalisation . but this request , namely an analysis be undertaken in good order qualified non precipitate and considering all the consequences , was not satisfied , and that is why the compromise now before us is for me to be admissible . 
fortunately we have a directive which requires transparency , on the part of public enterprises and i can assure you that the subsidies will be examined carefully . thugs 
i think that you have understood nothing , and it does not look as if you listened to the arguments which you have been tabled . 
users will be the losers , with employees , and the competitiveness and growth european-led régresseront yalta did . 
the liberalisation being proposed will not go without causing a major impact on the services provided in the countryside , on the workers in the sector and on the users dailies post . 
it is regrettable that the commission chose sheer headlong , according for with a proposal which does not take into account the views of certain interest groups in the population . 
this sector is suffering from fierce competition of these new technologies . 
invoking realism as with the broad left in an attempt to find a compromise solution with a part of the right is one way of its own capitulation before private interests . disguising 
this figure is largely sufficient to support the public service tasks , like a universal right route , and a uniform tariffs . 
i have nothing to learn from the labour party , upon respect of rural areas . 
mr president , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr ferber , who has not had an easy task , that is the least we can say . 
this is a decision you regretterez yalta did . 
mr president , in view of the discussions that preceded it , the commission is aware of how important this subject in the eyes of parliament ; i have also looked with great attention the many amendments to the draft directive . 
in short , this will be good enough and the power to arrive on time and to halt the momentum of change , if necessary , a fact , be seriously damaging the adjustments that are under way and a threat to employment in the long term . 
first of all the blame lies for posts to britain ’ , john , who has pointed out that competition roberts results in the standards of quality and efficiency as well as a reduction in prices . 
a monopoly on postal services is threatening to grind these and of causing loss of volumes , which , in turn , will lead to a drop in employment . 
we must nurture the momentum of change that is underway , launch the first step in the process , in practical terms a timescale of the reforms to come . 
i note that the postal services can help us to heat up the atmosphere in the chamber and i am pleased to say . 
the report proposes , amongst other things , the rejection of moving on to &apos; tariff only , a tariff preference for the acp that eur 300 – a minimum , an evaluation and a possible revision of the practices of the com . 
otherwise , our position remains therefore of the same : to date of implementation of the system are kept for at least ten years in order to guarantee legal certainty for manufacturers and operators , re-examination those ten years , not a case of moving on to &apos; tariff only wuori tariff preference of 300 euros for the acp countries . we require guarantees , should the system of management of quotas &apos; first come , which was the first served &apos; would be set up by the commission , because it will have serious repercussions on the acp producers , who are unable to be taken today has a place in the race to vessels which is soon to be initiated . 
mr schwaiger has said to you , in the previous debate , that you have to gather information complementing further the different opinions on the problem . 
the implementation of the compromise that is taken , which is part of the standards of the wto , must be analysed by the european commission in a report that parliament will have to study at a reasonable time period ; at the point of view of the extent of the report and its conclusions , it will be necessary to propose new measures , as the rapporteur stresses in his work . 
mr president , to observers perplexed like me , we move from a strange place at the drop of in this matter . from this surrealism 
the powerful forces resist that . 
and i think we could have predicted a negative effect on the smaller business operators and on the producers in the acp countries . 
mr president , i would like to stress , firstly , the endeavours of the european parliament , which is trying to achieve a balanced solution for worldwide complicated weave of interests and a fall in market organization . 
the conflict with the wto , has led to the form of trade sanctions , and it is not easy to explain this to exporters in the member states affected totally arbitrary in sectors that are totally unrelated . 
the important thing is to save time in the final straight , and i propose to vote in favour of the report by mr dary . 
mr president , once again , this house will give its opinion on the banana issue , and i congratulate mr michel for the excellent work he has done . dary 
we want to strengthen our cooperation with the republic of korea , and today we have an excellent opportunity to discuss the latest events in the korean peninsula . 
( parliament approved the commission proposal ) 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to confirm the commission &apos;s position as regards the amendments adopted yesterday evening by our colleague mr bolkestein . 
( the president declared the common position approved as amended ) 
this is &quot; hotbeds the hands of croatian citizens of serb origin &quot; . 
( parliament accepted the oral amendment ) 
i would like to support the important decision of the ep to vote in the introduction of health warnings graphs on cigarette packets . ( pt ) this is a step forward for public health because we will be gigantic now labels and images cigarette who reflect what the current situation is actually worth to smoke . 
the court of justice has also been proved right . 
it will lead not to smoke cigarettes lower but than export jobs . 
they have misled people for far too long . 
it is a matter of important programmes aimed at improving public health , the fight against cancer , aids prevention and combating drugs , control of health and diseases related to pollution . 
i do not see why you cannot also entrust to the public the management of its own social security . 
so i believe we must concern ourselves also - with all speed , we hope - pensionable artists . 
i therefore believe that this directive will have the effect of shifting the international market art outside european borders . 
across the announcements of good intentions on the stability and the rule of law , combating corruption , the oostlander report is really nothing more than a vote of confidence in mr putin . 
maij-weggen report ( a5-0323 / 2001 ) 
and , if we add to the corruption of european civil servants the bribing of officials from the public national , the fraud . &apos; are increasing 
the institution of this new authority must not lead to a flight of sovereignty in the area this is all about . 
i would like to apologise to parliament . 
i have received many letters which testify that he is an issue on our minds . 
the whole thing must be in balance . 
but the commission should provide this information to parliament on the basis of the information at annually are available to it . 
with regard to amendments nos 19 and 32 , concerning bananas , i too would like to repeat that heavens there are already horizontal measures that ensure equal treatment of bananas from third countries and those who have organic produce , at the community . 
more to the relationship will be good , safer will be the world and our people . 
there are differences in our approach to these matters , but i hope that this summit will send a positive message about the need to continue our efforts , together , partly by introducing aware like that of access to affordable medicines , with a tiered pricing yalta did . 
from kosovo in belfast , millions of european citizens have the food to be grateful to it and i know that this house would wish to pay tribute today . 
i think you have mentioned here that an important point . 
lesotho was wondering : what has given to the lesotho liberalising company by the wto ? 
i believe that the dialogue that exists between the european union and the united states should be used to attain finally achieving this objective . 
i am interested in what has been said by mrs lucas on the issue of world trade and the importance of trying to ensure that a trade which is becoming more and more free market to serve them , just as the interests of poor people than the issue of persons easy . 
the subject is closed . 
i stress this , because there are some proposals seek to establish a form of vat for services which i do not count for anything represent an centrality or socially . 
this solution resolves the problem with this discrimination and responds to the objective of simplification . 
mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the commission and parliament have made efforts in recent years in order to harmonise the collection of vat at the heart of the european union . 
the committee on industry has been a number of proposals by thirty-nine votes to three . 
there exist assumptions underlying down this proposal on the place of taxation that could cause problems in the future in an international context . 
many reasons to observe carefully whether airlift bears ess externalities and does not give rise to unfair competition for buses and trains . 
when this is going on between the member states of the european union , then the vat is perceived . 
it is very regrettable that there is still at present no framework directive on the taxation of energy production . 
the liberals agree with , then , are the ambitions of the commission , but we were very difficult to understand the specific proposals now before us . 
i believe it is important to be found of criteria for doing ! 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european commission proposal which aims to subject to vat buying digital téléchargés directly from the internet by the consumers &apos; resident in the union by companies from third countries , is a major blow to the development of the business . 
therefore , with regard to the commission &apos;s proposal to extend the deadline for the reform , i am not able to express that my neutrality , 
i am opposed to the wish for harmonisation of vat in mrs torres marques has said . but this in particular i would like to refer to the report by mr garcía-margallo for e-commerce . 
all the states to pass this at least 30 , which are often of 40 and sometimes more than 50 % of their national wealth created in the year . 
what is needed is the sort of minimum rates , a rate maximum figures , but we must give member states sufficient room for them to be able for policies microeconomic clean . 
personally , i have tabled an amendment on harmonising vat rates which aim at correcting the effects of introducing unfair competition , because , in the field of vat rates and the operators of third countries have , at the time that they register , a large choice the registration , given the differences are considerable - between 15 and 25 % , whereas the community do not have the choice . 
if in addition we say that the unilateral aviation fuel in europe , european companies really should have a great deal of trouble to stay competitive in the face with the companies from outside europe yalta did . 
this is not the way that we have to organise their society and that is why i believe this is a proposed an excellent one . 
not only the aircraft rates would increase dramatically – perhaps by 80 pounds a ticket , thereby threatening the very existence of more small - but these damage would be imposed on top industrialists aerospace , tourism , trade and , obviously , the carriers cargo carrying now today one-third merchandise global by air . 
i agree with mr skinner , that the proposals made by the rapporteur , mr garcía-margallo y marfil , on the vat applied to e-commerce , are good . 
i would like to comment just on the taxation of fuel of aviation . 
how to impose a vat rate for the providers of third countries , mainly american , not only is not a very easy but , in the case of the newspapers and books , creates the inconsistencies between &apos;un products sold on line and this same product will be sold in shops . 
my third point concerns the eu should not establish a right which is too early and should do everything in its power to reinforce europe &apos; s e-business and not vice insécuriser yalta did . 
the results of this meeting has been discussed in ecofin to the end of november . 
a whole series of points of detail has yet to be settled . 
it is against that background that this proposal seeks to keep up the harmonisation existing regarding reduced vat rates in pointing to the minimum level of 15 % for the normal rate . 
i should like to remind you that the community tax rules current ne taxing flying national and community . 
one year after the erika disaster , we should all ask ourselves if we were able , or not , to meet the expectations of citizens . 
in case the imo will not adopt the necessary measures , the commission would submit to parliament and council a proposal on a community system for liability and compensation in cases of pollution , also thinking of the oil reserves . 
parliament has taken its decision on 30 november , and from having a good model , and we have decided quickly . 
as regards the question of liability , i would just say that the existing fund is not enough to provide compensation for all the damage caused by the oil the erika . 
mr ortuondo , on the subject of your speech , which concerns article 6 , on liability for pollution can be a minor one , i will just see what the council says , but parliament has already on a position on the subject . 
the overall objective of this law was to eliminate the distortions in competition with one mechanism equitable passing the costs of infrastructure on on hauliers and harmonise the systems of financial cost to the eu &apos;s internal market . 
i thought that the two would be addressed at the same time , however , it is not the procedure of this house . 
the policy with regard to imports from third countries will be reviewed in relation to that assessment . 
the role of the european union is not to finance the furtherance of hatred and to war . 
i understand you asked what the commission &apos;s participation in programmes educational , and you told me next to , commissioner . 
étudiera-t-il the possibilities of widening the relevant segment of the community budget ? 
allow me to say about texaco be sought from the centre for social and economic rights la stems responsible for a large number of abortions , and of a rate of cancer abnormal en equator . 
how does it intend , as from january 2001 , the survival of the rest of this sector in the face of unfair competition from korea , yet again been demonstrated in this last report . 
commissioner , i have felt , first and foremost , of pressure off , to some extent , to see that the commission has been concerned , and perhaps there is some degree of this problem . 
we believe that they might not be the case , if we extend the aid to the operation every quarter . instead , the commission must be prepared to move forward a specific instrument , targeted in the event that the actions taken on its behalf by commissioner lamy would yield a results for the industry concerned in the european union . 
the increase in price that would result anti-dumping measures should enable a return to profitability industry coke yalta did . 
this proposal . this is a follow-up to the repeated promises of the community in favour of the ldcs , aims to promote the integration of citizens in the world economy . 
i am sure all my fellow members of this parliament are for this . 
this is to mrs kinnock &apos;s question . 
to this end , perhaps you could begin with my saying , though , when the impact assessment is available so that we are able to cite , in order to push breaking up some of the allegations apocalyptic surrounding your proposal and then give some further details concerning the safeguard clause to that i think that you plan to introduce into this measure in this way that the transition period before its entry into force in permanently . 
these different instruments are also available to organisations like ecpat and partners , with whom they work together in the countries concerned . 
we have had a particular project for that . 
why the european patent office is established in thessaloniki . 
he is a point of view perfectly understandable , and i share . 
the commission will therefore take all the measures it deems necessary . 
the commission would like to inform the honourable member for an action is currently pending regarding the draft of the thessaloniki underground railway . 
in this regard , i must also point out that , once the agreement regarding the provision is made known in greece , the complainant receives eight months to make up its own view and apply a complaint to the commission . 
defining lawful a strike is a competence of the member state . 
i would like to thank the commissioner who was made , has been my position to answer the question , but i would like to point out that , at the moment , in greece , the students have to cope with the state of confusion follows : on the one hand , our studies , maintain that , under directive free 89 / 48 / eec , they are empowered to issue diplomas studies that are likely to be acknowledged , on condition that these investigations are still in progress in the united kingdom , and on the other hand , the greek authorities and the competent bodies are not willing to recognise these diplomas awarded to completion of the studies are in great britain . 
proclaiming the isle of raippaluoto off vaasa kingdom independent basis , which would enable shipowners in question of continuing to bury duty-free sales . 
however , i am sure i can say , on behalf of my colleague michel barnier , that the facts mentioned by the honourable member will be duly taken into account in the analysis of this proposal . 
let me briefly state what is the important part of my report and the point that i believe that it is one for this parliament , namely the issue of the priorité-clé linguistic diversity . 
it is essential for us to win over the commercial providers of the gains and new potential to potential for investment in companies that take into account linguistic diversity and the exploitation of information to the public sector . 
this means that the digital content is an opportunity for all those who have not had access to school , either for the whole of their lives , either because they are disabled , and i hope that this substance digital will enhance our approach . 
that can be provided to locate the production of content . this presupposes the adaptation of products on the basis of need , linguistic and cultural and the preferences of the consumer . 
mr president , i should like to congratulate mrs gill on her report . 
the content providers , the sector to be creative , the people who are ultimately responsible for local production of content and on which we are also addressed the e-content programme with the member states , should therefore be involved in this consultation . 
before i finish , mr president , i should like to mention one final important point , one last question to the commission . 
i would like to thank parliament for its firm support for the budget of this programme . 
the debate is closed . 
the floor , mr de roo . 
a surfeit structural ado is harmful to human health and is reducing their quality of life . 
the environment committee is proposing here in concrete standards for the years 2006 ; 2012 and 2020 . 
quite right to do more for the popular party , such as we , the ppe group , not to give air traffic escape the european regulation and also so that no longer wants any distinctions between military air traffic and civil . 
my group does not back on the other hand , the rapporteur &apos;s view of wanting to establish , through a directive on maximum levels of noise ambient for airports . 
i therefore agree with the rapporteur , mr de roo , for example , recommends that they should not lose time and to transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise and , a framework directive , mandatory . 
viewed from another group it is said to have technical problems . 
the member states , in accordance with their traditions , the duration of that time at a would fix bracket entering . 
i am very surprised by one or other say that we must for subsidiary directives yalta did . 
so we need the framework directive and of a combined approach . that is why i believe that many of the decisions of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy are fair and correct . 
that is not what we want . 
we will make a major step forward when we have comparable data from the noise around airports . 
the debate is closed . 
this survey , has never been made . 
mr president , at this late hour and with a piece of carrot dans his throat , i think we are now no longer having a great deal to add to my colleagues . 
these people are aware , for many years now from the way in which chemical pulp is used as and tie them down , above all within bread . 
as i have already explained in the second reading , a crisis is at the root of this amendment of directive . 
i believe that parliament is a considerable improvement on the council &apos;s common position and i recommend the approval of the text of a common project . 
i should like to thank the european parliament for supporting the position of the european commission and for the huge efforts made to meet the concerns of the council . 
we know that the commission is preparing to present a programme of sustainable development throughout the european union which should be ready in six months . 
as a legislature , we should never seek to strengthen the opposition between urban and countryside . 
the appropriations will be mainly intended for the networks of towns and cities have been organised at european level in their work in the field of development and dissemination of best practice as regards sustainable urban development . 
furthermore , in practice , it is at local level that the decisions we take in this parliament must be carried out . 
i believe that this innovative approach , can constitute a model for others . 
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 26 , 31 , 38 and 39 . 
indeed , even if the media in the support for very long , the precautionary principle is not a question of making its appearance in the wider legal organization . 
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on legal affairs has risen to a few points concerning the precautionary principle , which are reflected in the excellent report by mrs patrie has said . 
the public no longer wants to pay the price of technological inventions which are dangerous from which it turns out , you have a number of so many years on , whether they involve unnecessary risks to public health or the environment . 
i am in favour of the precautionary principle . but i want to deal with a single point of concern . 
one must bear some of the issues in mind in order to ensure the smooth functioning . 
firstly , there is no such thing as a minimum level below which the precautionary principle may not be taken away with , so even in cases where there is weak , then he can be made to use the precautionary principle . 
in the amendments which i tabled , i am trying to shed more light on these points and to remove anything useless . 
it is incomprehensible that the european union remains deaf to dozens of scientific studies which are independent , which indicate a risk even mobile phones to human health . 
producers and manufacturers must be able to submit the evidence of the safety of their products . 
mr president , accepted by all giving sauces , according to the circumstances and interests of the moment , the precautionary principle can be the best from our point of view , as the worst of things . 
we think that this constitutes a general principle that should be taken into account in the fields of environmental protection , and also of human health , animal and plant yalta did . 
thank you , commissioner liikanen . 
our european community is , above all a community of values based on respect for the rule of law . 
we know that , personally , we are not important , but we believe that what unites us on and we mobilises is an important , namely the rejection of terrorism murderer eta and also our support explicit about the rule of law of the spanish , who is now threatened by a totalitarian project secession violent . 
ladies and gentlemen , as democrats , we are , obviously , those advocates of the dialogue between the different democratic parties , because democracy itself consists of a permanent dialogue . 
we are proceeding to the signing of the budget 2001 . 
( in successive votes parliament adopted both legislative resolutions ) 
( parliament gave its assent to the oral amendment ) ( parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) 
before moving on to the explanations of vote , to all those men and all those families that i do not , may i wish in appallingly reverrai holidays christmas . 
since its inception , the cohesion fund has had a major impact in two areas of great interest to the community - the environment and the trans-european transport networks , and acted as a good example of effective implementation of the community budget and the rate of implementation to the highest level in the entire eu budget . 
we ask that , in january , a supplementary and amending budget to take advantage of the interest which this house wants illustrates give this dossier . 
the government of luxembourg , that is , of course , being called upon to be vigilant , but also to ensure compliance with the treaties . 
this one has to suffer more radical reforms in the future , not least to be replaced by eu enlargement . 
mr president , i voted in favour of this report on food additives , and particularly in favour of the ban on the use of sodium alginate in retain les carrots . 
i suggest that as it also provide a copy to malta , since the only explanation of vote that he was not carried out is , i believe , when we were talking about malta . 
if , today , i have voted in favour of the ferber report on ‘ european postal services &quot; it is because i believe that in the current state of play of forces in europe and in the european parliament , we have achieved the most of what we could to prevent the disappearance of the public postal service in europe ! 
i very much regret that parliament should have finished , in the vote , with support to a position that is very bad for consumers . 
i emphatically reject that respect is hypocritical . 
it is not enough to recommend the freeing up if we do not understand the effects of our decisions . 
in sweden , this proposal has already , in part , been applied and we can now see that this has led to a worse position than before . 
we hope that the negotiations to open up quickly and that they will ultimately lead to an agreement compatible with the commitments we made in the wto framework and with the interests of our traditional suppliers . 
things must be clear : i am fully aware of the interests of that body , but i refuse , in conjunction with others , that is not global village ! 
secondly , the report deals overly negatively linguistic and cultural diversity . 
it is obvious that europe is able to meet the challenge of the markets , with the advantages that economic and employment and of course , with its cultural wealth and to its linguistic diversity – which are mentioned in the notion of minority-language explicitly and of regional languages , over the monolinguisme characterising a large part of the &apos; network . &quot; 
mr president , i asked my daughter , elisabetta , which , as you know , is , you of the pensioners &apos; party in lombardy left to me give an opinion on the council of nice : what it thought of it , if she considers that we were due to vote in favour . 
the latter is now ready for accession of applicant states . 
they help people may have succeeded , at least temporarily , but at the cost of serious shortcomings , to include more supranationalism less democracy , increase in the federal republic of germany in the decision-making process . 
this is a development which may appear quite legitimate for some , because it tends to put into the institutions weights respective countries &apos; in terms of its peoples . 
he would possibly result from it the greatest difficulties in the implementation of laws that are necessary in the sectors of the environment , public health and consumer protection and of the working environment . and we strongly urge all the different countries to show a sense of responsibility and to improve the effectiveness of decision-making procedures within the council . 
the negotiations were difficult , but the power of the union in its determination to facilitating solutions acceptable to all was yalta did . 
this is exacerbated by enlargement of the decisions by qualified majority , 14 countries which could , under certain circumstances , take decisions on behalf of 27 or 28 , given that it eliminates des in practice the right of veto on the policies that are very important for portugal , such as those of the structural funds , or agreements on trade policy . 
we maintain the unanimity in council and , therefore , an inability latent into action . 
for our part , as long as europe is what it is , questions of the reach of constitutional or with an interest , which is fundamental for the states , such as those that have been debated in nice , cannot be dealt with in a different way . they must be taken unanimously . 
this has the effect of increasing the power of large countries at the expense of small ones . 
these low prices are not only the result of cuts in staffing levels as well as of other economies , but also of public policy . 
&quot; ‘ so let us go to bed , and let us do the marriage . 
whereas the structures of attainment hall have been to achieve a successful project approach to an approach by programme within the framework of this programme - what can already take issue , because a proportion of its proximity to citizens , from the added value and visibility of europe is already lost , in my opinion , and also because the member states have not all that was created by the regional authorities - has led the innovative actions on esf maintain principles-based project . 
the main thing is to determine which of them , but we must also be strong enough to recognize that this does not work , they must not be at the expense of the state and the recovery to adopt a strategy that takes account of this aspect . 
tourism is a significant economic activity , even in certain peripheral regions . 
this is a good report and it is based on a good commission document . 
i agree in particular in order to say that the instruments of regional policy must be geared towards sustainability , the strengthening of economic and social cohesion , and , above all , the creation of jobs , part-time , economically viable and sustainable . 
firstly , we , and those on the spot , consider the innovative measures have been a very useful for the authorities and the stepping stone in local communities do not exactly form part of the structural funds , but that needs to be expected , in order to learn to manage smaller-scale projects in order to be able to play a more effective role in programmes dominant in the coming years . 
so we finance them helm road and they have lost that value added by the direct relationship between the european and government institutions umbrella closest to the problems of citizens . 
that is why we have chosen as strategic priorities that the three priorities : innovation on technology and information society , but also regional identity and sustainable development . 
i understand your desire to maintain direct links between the european union and the regional and local actors . 
thank you commissioner . 
the decision of the council and commission to negotiate for four months , without subsidies , and then to decide , as from 1 may 2001 on the basis of the results obtained , with reference can be extended to it that the shipbuilding industry , will lead europe fail décrochera hardly a contract in the first four months of 2001 , at least not in the sectors very disputed sites . 
on the other countries , such as japan , to suffer from it too . 
who are different concerns in relation to the sixth framework programme for research and development . in its draft , the line &quot; marine technology &apos; , which existed in the fifth , appears to have , today , have disappeared . 
mr president , on the eve of the end of year will have a debate on the situation in the shipbuilding sector seems to become a tradition . 
in recent weeks , the commission has told us that the programme of subsidies which mean that our industry can thrive , was to be abolished in january for the sake of a supposedly enhancing its competitiveness . 
so , it is the state who will pay a large degree , if not all , the profits of this enterprise . 
this is because we are unable to condemn an unfair advantage . 
the debates in the oecd have made little progress , and very little progress , and the possibility of concluding a binding commitment at international level in the area of the shipbuilding industry seems remote . 
he has asked the commission to continue monitoring the situation of the market , to keep a close the procedure to give , if need be , tbr affair to the wto , and to raise the question of shipyards , in all international fora , relevant . 
british submarine in gibraltar 
there , with a command absolute on-the-spot they stationnèrent yalta did . 
mr president , with regard to the repair of the british submarine tireless in gibraltar , it is worth pointing out what is required of the commission . 
i would like to quietly suggest to them to support our motion for a resolution . 
secondly , it must demand that are provided to the population in all the necessary information , as indicated by the euratom treaty . 
the honourable members raised a number of questions about the presence of the nuclear submarine hms tireless in gibraltar , for whom he was a need to repair the nuclear reactor . 
the uk government and say that you can do so in writing . ( da ) transportation of radioactive waste in transit through from the member states and that they maintain regular contact with the spanish authorities . 
this concerns a technical problem which needs a response a technical one . the sooner the repairs will be completed , the better for everyone . 
we all support the right to self-determination . 
it is particularly significant . and this is where i would like to press in that it demonstrates to what conditions we now have in europe and united in this respect , it is almost even funny for genetically nationalists to swallow . 
it is scandalous that , at the moment 11 nuclear submarines of attack on the 12 simultaneous navy royal of are blocked . four are in repair and seven are showing signs of exhaustion of the sort that standstill tillich hms tireless yalta did . 
the specific instance is more serious than all of this since it concerns , on the european community , hundreds of thousands of human beings , not only of spain , of course , but also of all nationalities , especially british . 
i would point out , to come back to the content of the draft resolutions about the role of the commission , that the british government does not consider that the euratom treaty will be applicable in situations servicemen of this kind . 
these sentiments , pressed the debate , it is understandable , but the honourable members know that in responding on behalf of mrs wallström , i have to confine myself to determine as clearly as possible what is part and that which is not within community competence . 
b5-0928 / 2000 by mr watson , on behalf of the eldr group , 
the suicide mainly amongst young people can no longer put up with their location hopelessness 
he has participated in operations specific in the general secretary or any other authority , from the un has asked it and in accordance with the countries concerned . 
we will continue to work in this spirit to work out the proposals on the instrument that will replace the dublin convention , the conditions for the asylum qualifications on the basis of the geneva convention and the subsidiary forms of protection . 
the commission is also working closely with unhcr , with a view to ensuring a smooth transition from the humanitarian and development . 
b5-0929 / 2000 by mr haarder and malmström , on behalf of the eldr group , 
solana , we have been told , to understand those requirements , but you also told us , and i quote , that it is difficult to deal with a regime such as milosovic yalta did . 
this of course it is this , or else the combine à &apos;une amnesty . 
the request to president kostunica to release all political prisoners in the period milosovic also calls for diplomatic efforts of the european council and commission at incessant belgrade especially now that the majority of political prisoners serb have , i think , been set free in the intervening period , except those of albanian origin out of kosovo . 
i can assure you , ladies and gentlemen , that this is an issue which i will deal - not only as a result of this debate - during my next visit to belgrade after the elections on 23 december . 
mozambique- b5-0907 / 2000 by mr queiró , on behalf of the uen group ; 
on tunisia . 
i would remind you that , at a european parliament delegation in argentina , the former president alfonsín has told us that the democracies ne remembers sometimes other democracies than out when there is , in other words , after more democracy . 
mr president , the european parliament awards southern africa in the agenda , particularly the fact that mozambique , which is one of the poorest countries in the world that you will remember , was last year by a natural disaster ravaged immeasurable . 
we regret that the other political groups were not prepared to do it this time . 
consequently , we urge the commission to ensure a strict monitoring of adherence to conditions in that country and i have nothing , of course , be considered to be the same time respecting the human rights . 
tunisia 
so might mehdi zougah citizen franco-tunisien , arrested in tunis on 11 august , at the airport . 
the assembly house publishing aloes , of which the premises have been shut down a number of months , is being prevented from publish freely . 
the motives for accusations are very vague . 
mr president , i would firstly like to express my thanks to the solidarity expressed by others on the most recent murder of the terrorist group eta . 
the call for an association council meeting dedicated to the human rights situation in tunisia must be followed by actual effects ... 
our experience to chile in the area of democracy and human rights was , therefore , crucial for important further projects in other countries . 
in the coming weeks we will have to examine the results of the dialogue between the two political leaders , or to take note of the absence of such a dialogue . 
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions : 
and this is not by chance that the oau and numerous african heads of state , absolutely condemn tropospheric ivoirité . 
the collapse of the price of cocoa , the crushing weight of foreign debt and the increase in fuel prices , among others , have pushed the country towards a situation internally is marked by increased tensions , a substantial reduction in the climate of social , a rise in unemployment and poverty . 
we members of this parliament we have a duty to safeguard the rights of the people of côte d &apos;ivoire is concerned - and elsewhere - to a democratic system to be a fair and well organised , with a judicial power non-partisan yalta did . 
i would like to make it clear that the commission shares parliament &apos;s view that the process of transition from a military coup to an elected government in the ivory coast is a long way , and this is a euphemism , standards of democracy that we want to see applied . 
with regard to the allusions uncalled uttered at me , i must say that i thank this not mean that in normal weather conditions and i wished to , at no stage skew the normal course of the debate . 
as you know , honourable member , i said two speakers here this afternoon in parliament on this issue , but what i have talked about this was , within the competence of the commission , not on omni-compétence yalta did . 
the european parliament is not sovereign in setting a timetable . 
faced with this problem , it requires a great deal of sensitivity and to work towards the creation of a solidarity inter-générations absolutely crucial to the drafting of a series of political importance à character holistic and implementing the social security , social protection , and above all to ensure that every country should have included in its concepts the elderly are not the idea that cultural a burden on society but that they should be seen as a resource , a human resource foremost a social resource next , a resource and , finally , an even cultural huge funds of experience to be passed on to subsequent generations . 
the thinking which is developing and the policy we must do in this area are of particular importance during this period in which the eu sets out to modernise our social model and he ties indissolubly economic development , social progress and quality of life and social integration of all citizens . 
the low level of employment of older employees is something which the european parliament should have done something long time ago . 
the shortage is made for it being used as an argument , to raise the retirement age and throwing away the amorces for reduction processes open previously . 
the oecd has already carried out research into this issue , a few years ago , launched on the reports . 
the present report ignores amply their valuable contribution to society . 
mr president , the commission communication is concerned , i think , an important step in the history of the social policy , because it puts a stop to a time when the mention of the third age lasts by looking at this point as the generation of deprived or the disabled . 
given that the markets are only looking to the young people and to their purchasing power , the cases of the older people remain in the remit of the policy . 
one of our colleagues has said : it is not the who are living too long , it is not our society which is too old , but only a few centuries people up much more quickly than the good lord dying explained liked to include this on the agenda in our genes . 
this is the wrong , in view of the demographic situation current and future , and given also that the assets of today are as inactive tomorrow &apos; in economic terms . 
article 13 of the report which i have been presented to parliament , the month of october this confirms that the wheel discrimination impacts on the age . 
furthermore , i would want , at all costs , that all women are because we actually want to do that women &apos;s participation in active world of work to be strengthened by a family policy and taxes . 
i have the photographs of him , when the union jack tricoloured has been pushed back to walking mount dolphins and à briançon yalta did . 
the problem of ageing is a part of the most important objectives . they set the new process of cooperation in the field of social protection . 
we shall now proceed to the vote . 
this is a very desirable development along the lines of what is already in the promotion of agricultural products in third countries . 
it could take you to a degree of unanimity , without doubt , having known the greatness of mind , even of the commission would lead in accepting all of our amendments . 
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a member of the working group on the wto and in particular , as representative for smes , i can only congratulate the commission for this report and this measure because it provides for the shifts of large scale , which are geared towards the future . 
it is a case , of course , a great opportunity for the rural world , which precisely will plug thereby their distance from the major centres of population , and new opportunities are being created which , ultimately , of course , apply worth certainly taken into account . 
we now hope that parliament will follow them very broadly , and , naturally , i call upon my group to support you and square . 
the fact that for the calves to add the fat is coming from the manufacture of animal meal , which obviously is highly dubious , to be adopted concerning the transmission of the mad cow disease - is a new source of contamination for young people of their animals . 
the system of the promotional actions is one element of the malfunctioning of the agricultural policy of the eu . 
i sincerely hope that what is proposed is not going to mean that there is any point of view of certain interest groups to those things that good and safe , but that we will have information on the basis of scientific data are not adequate . 
the concept of the measures on information and promotion of trade which complement the national provisions , which requires a strong commitment from member states by means of co-financing and for monitoring of measures to be taken . 
whilst not sought , it seems that i will be the last speaker of the year 2000 . 
returning to the set aside , we could consider , in practice that the set-aside is not the consequence is to be facing a rotation of crops , but rather that the companies are using the wrong set-aside for remaining fallowing permanent and to undertake an exploitation always much more intensive and chemical des alia rotation between cultures . 
consider , mrs lulling , that the extra seconds that i gave you your christmas present . 
here i totally agree with the contribution of our liberal colleague jan mulder .
