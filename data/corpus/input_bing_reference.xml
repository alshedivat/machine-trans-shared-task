<p><seg id="1"> this exacerbates the anti-democratic nature of the european union , and i hope that mr moscovici has understood that mr prodi has erected today &apos; hui a genuine bulwark against these actions . furthermore , i really hope that this trend will be interrupted and reversed to the councils in nice and biarritz .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="2"> these negotiations , we know , are very difficult and have raised fears of a failure or an agreement has minima at nice , which would be even more serious , you have already agreed , the minister .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="3"> any other way to do would result in a major democratic deficit .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="4"> mr president , mr president prodi , mr president of the council , ladies and gentlemen , i thank the delegation of the european parliament to the convention and its president , roman herzog , for their committed work .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="5"> mr president moscovici , i ask you , with the utmost seriousness , to think about the next thing : if you delete behind the single decision of cologne and don &apos;t want to consider what to with great difficulty the eventual integration of the charter into the treaties , what encouragement those who violated human rights would of our procrastination ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="6"> but on it i would like to mark if not disagreement , at least from the shades on two points .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="7"> he was right to stress the progress made since the fall of the wall and german reunification , ten years ago .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="8"> she also made an extremely interesting suggestion concerning the link between the charter and the discussion on a possible article 7 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="9"> this work is possible , and the study conducted by the university institute in florence makes an excellent base to perform this task efficiently .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="10"> here , mr moscovici , i do not think that the one must pass all community .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="11"> now however , we observe that president putin has a policy of openness to the west .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="12"> report ( a5-0235 / 2000 ) by mr skinner , on behalf of the committee economic and monetary affairs , on the communication from the commission entitled &apos; risk capital : proposals to continue the implementation of the action plan &apos; ( com ( 1999 ) 493 - c5-0320 / 1999 - 1999 / 2208 ( cos ) )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="13"> is there not here two weights , two measures ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="14"> recommendation for second reading piecyk ( a5-0232 / 2000 )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="15"> at the same time , the introduction of larger buses would reduce the number of buses in circulation , which would be less detrimental to the environment .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="16"> risking its own capital is a very dangerous activity .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="17"> in fact , entrepreneurs are most often comparable to players who hope to hit the jackpot .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="18"> it is , however , clear on the right of ownership , freedom of enterprise , affecting especially the minority who owns capital , the right to use and abuse .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="19"> mr president , i abstained in the vote on the resolution on the charter of fundamental rights of the european union because i find this still very unsatisfactory charter , despite some progress .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="20"> as a member of the delegation of the european parliament here , and after having worked with my colleagues for eight months on the subject , i have to say that the charter of fundamental rights could represent , indeed , added value for l &apos; europe but that , l &apos; current state of things , it cannot be satisfied or its content , nor the working methods which presided over its development .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="21"> the csu group in the european parliament favours the horizontal provision which establishes that no new competence is created for the community and for the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="22"> because we believe that the process constituting europe deserves a true public and democratic debate , there may be political construction of europe without social rights and democracy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="23"> the vote is closed .

<p><seg id="24"> ( a5-0249 / 00 ) by mr poos on cyprus ( com ( 1999 ) 502 - c5-0025 / 2000 - 1997 / 2171 ( cos ) ) ;
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="25"> i am convinced that some countries will be able to make sufficient preparations in this time .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="26"> the french presidency will inform immediately the commission over which you preside , mr brok , the outcome of these negotiations as early as tuesday afternoon , as is now the custom between us .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="27"> we have indeed , in perfect agreement with commissioner verheugen , negotiations on 42 new chapters , which means 4 to 9 depending on the country , just as the portuguese presidency before us .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="28"> but the date of january 1 , 2003 , which is the only one that the union is agreed , is an extremely ambitious goal for candidates and for us , and it is in this perspective that the presidency will mobilize all its efforts .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="29"> i am ready , of course , to follow the very important debate that brings together us today &apos; hui .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="30"> ongoing , the largest enlargement in the history of european unification , is morally desirable , strategically necessary and politically feasible .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="31"> if we see that countries engaged in the enlargement process have already reached within a very short time , the stability of their democratic systems , this is a performance that these peoples have done themselves .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="32"> to the institutions of the eu , they must be used to monitor the success of the process and to pursue the development of trading strategies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="33"> i mention only agriculture , environment , regional policy , legal and internal affairs and the budget. as preparation , the commission is working on a new monitoring system which will allow us to evaluate precisely and at any time the status of the negotiations and the actual implementation for each country .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="34"> mr president , minister , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing today &apos; hui of the brok report devoted to the progress of the enlargement process of the european union - a subject that returns each year .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="35"> in our view , paragraph 25 and the amendment filed my group on this subject are essential .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="36"> mr president , mr brok &apos;s report is an excellent description of the position of the european parliament .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="37"> the challenge of reunification , more than that of the enlargement probably is so huge that it invades or surrounds all parliamentary debates . this explains the depth and intensity that emerge from all our discussions , including the debate this morning on the need to prepare for this extraordinary challenge .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="38"> the important thing is to not let frustration among the candidate countries which , let us remember , even is they wait in the antechamber , have not yet entered into the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="39"> our group considers that acting in a determined manner , it is entirely possible that the first group to join at the time of the next elections to the european parliament , but we must act decisively to another .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="40"> the differences regarding what is affirmed in the brok report are details that most important points .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="41"> on all these subjects , the brok report , merely to talk about adaptation of reforms .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="42"> the personal involvement of the rapporteurs of the committee on foreign affairs , rights of man , common security and defence policy , and the exchange of fertile perspective that there took place , are inevitably going in the same direction .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="43"> enlargement , i just said , it is a historical process , it is a duty .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="44"> it is the credibility of the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="45"> we create the conditions for success , because it is important that this enlargement is not an outbreak , that this enlargement is not just a symbolic decision which , then , will create problems .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="46"> any of you should be surprised that those responsible for the negotiations , the prime ministers , the presidents of parliament , your colleagues in the national parliaments complain that things are not quite quickly - regardless of whether it really is there a sport enjoyed in europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="47"> do not attach date can awaken disappointment , attach a date too early can lead to a certain complacency : this means therefore that we look at the question of the date at the appropriate time , when we can say with sufficient certainty to what such date or such country will be ready for accession or not .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="48"> we have already very widely .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="49"> until i was born , freedom and democracy had the top on oppression and madness of the war , and a european union was incorporated .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="50"> these countries are a rich source of culture , diversity and multiple possibilities of which unified europe cannot happen .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="51"> if estonia knows approach effective and focused , during the negotiations , it has a good chance of becoming one of the new member states of the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="52"> the criticisms and proposals in my report on urgent and necessary progress in administrative and social matters are intended to quickly and successfully lead latvia in the european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="53"> it is our duty to continue to support latvia on the question of the integration of the russian population .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="54"> the link still existing between lithuania &apos;s currency and the dollar plays also a role in the matter because the litas follows the rise of the dollar against the euro . this causes a decline in contracts for export of lithuania to the euro area .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="55"> it is the only way to improve the possibility of development for kaliningrad also .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="56"> many of us think that , to stimulate and maintain this living support , it would have been useful to indicate dates for accession .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="57"> a particular problem faced by the czech republic , including at the border with germany , is that of prostitution , especially prostitution .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="58"> we are in the midst of a process of negotiations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="59"> the problems that i have mentioned are not insurmountable .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="60"> these policies must lead to assimilation , not forced , to individuals belonging to this community .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="61"> the resolution and the report which concern us focus on some of the more controversial issues , namely nuclear safety , border controls , the treatment of minorities and the problem of corruption .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="62"> do is perhaps not a coincidence that the same public survey reveals that the ambassador to the european union is the second most popular personality in romania today &apos; hui .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="63"> mr president , commissioner , your rapporteur shares the view of the report from the commission on slovenia and notes that the criticisms expressed in 1998 constituted a salutary shock to the slovenian authorities , who have since then responded by speeding up the adoption of the necessary measures for accession .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="64"> the perpetuation of the status quo , result of the turkish invasion of july-august 1974 , is not acceptable for the european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="65"> it was only logical that the european council in helsinki , in december of last year , gave the green light , in the context of the extension of the accession negotiations , the resumption of the negotiations with malta .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="66"> the trend that we note in this report to encourage polish politicians to speed up the legal adaptation to the eu and to implement acquired it , as well as the conclusion , a few days ago , of the agreement on the liberalization of the polish agricultural market emit positive signs in this regard .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="67"> on this point , he has the full support of our committee .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="68"> let me address a few priority elements .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="69"> this is why we we can , to stay honest , develop constantly new barriers in these areas .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="70"> basically , we however need to consider one thing : the remarkable efforts and the absolute will of the candidate countries for enlargement to join the european union should be sufficient motivation to prepare ourselves for this enlargement .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="71"> mr president , perhaps we tend to think that the accession of new member states automatically assumes that they must meet more stringent standards for the protection of the environment and nature .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="72"> mr president , when pandora opened her box , the ills of mankind were freed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="73"> this is why my report devotes a large part of its recommendations to the need to encourage the phare programme to do more in the field of health and to encourage the countries to cooperate now in the context of action programmes in health and in other sectors .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="74"> we must begin to talk about this integrated and polycentric european development .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="75"> we have heard something on the theme of the carrot in the sector policy and regional promotion .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="76"> there are one number of other points raised by the committee on regional policy in its report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="77"> to avoid repeats of the same scenario , it is essential to ensure that enlargement does not benefit only men , but also women .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="78"> the fact that the spirits are more weighted is that proof - i previously warned in the same terms of colleagues in central europe - that we went from honeymoon to the normal reality of the household .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="79"> results of the intergovernmental conference depend on the inevitable conditions so that the eu can undertake its enlargement .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="80"> the group of the greens and regionalists argues for a conclusion of the negotiations with the first group of countries at the end of 2002 , so that the first accessions can take place before the next european elections in 2004 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="81"> the various reports reflect this mainstream .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="82"> barely out of your old prison , do not enter a new .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="83"> i believe precisely what going already too fast at six , then fifteen , we have demonstrated our inability to build a europe which respects differences in its first members .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="84"> we will see a strengthening of competition and an acceleration of the reform process , including in europe western .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="85"> at various phases , however , measures have been taken , during and after the second world war , which obviously do not match the criteria of copenhagen since l &apos; spirit prevailing in l &apos; time , but what qu &apos; it , c &apos; is on these laws that was developed l &apos; ideological architecture and policy of this period including the peace treaties .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="86"> for all these reasons , and based on our own experience in greece , our opposition to &apos; expansion of l &apos; european union is l &apos; expression d &apos; a fraternal solidarity to &apos; respect of workers and , in general , peoples and the l candidate countries &apos; accession .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="87"> it is imperative that the accession negotiations between romania and the european union detail exactly what the romanian government needs to improve the standards and quality of orphanages in this country .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="88"> example , in mr gawronski &apos;s report , the commission is invited to consider appropriate measures to promote the development and strengthening of synergies between poland , lithuania and the russian region of kaliningrad .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="89"> mr verheugen , as chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development , i took the opportunity to visit the countries candidates for accession .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="90"> the poos report underlines that democracy , in cyprus , working to perfection , because respect for human rights &apos; man and freedoms is the cornerstone of traditional social and cultural of l &apos; island , and social structures of the country are clearly centered on the human person .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="91"> the audiovisual sector is very important .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="92"> mr president , today &apos;s debate &apos; today focuses on the great challenge of this change of millennium : unify europe to establish peace and security , and promote development in social , economic and environmental fields .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="93"> mr president , as a member of the parliamentary delegation joint eu-lithuania , i would like to support the remarks made by mrs hoff in his report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="94"> the blatant discrimination are committed in other countries , as in poland and to malta .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="95"> it is a process that is accomplished with varying success , but it is bearer of great hopes insofar as these citizens will become one day citizens of the union and will therefore called specially to establish links with their homeland .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="96"> so stop you want to replace the principle &apos; every man according to his results &quot; with &quot; each depending on its results , but my first elections &apos; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="97"> its cooperation with the international community during the kosovo conflict and its balanced role at the time are crucial for the whole region .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="98"> these efforts include the privatization and restructuring of the economy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="99"> ignorant and excluded cannot form the information society but are the sign of its failure .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="100"> member states could do more in their twinning to help candidate countries to develop their administrative capacity .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="101"> these regions of l &apos; europe are ready , especially cyprus .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="102"> enlargement consists of a grouping of economic forces , admittedly , but this grouping could also produce significant gains in the future , on the economy , increasing the size of the market and growth on our continent .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="103"> mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the importance and the scope of the historic opportunity that is offered to us to unite our continent in peace cannot be ignored .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="104"> here , we must add that we must be prepared to apply them at the administrative level .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="105"> as vice president of our joint parliamentary committee eu-czech republic , i know that this is the case in the czech republic and i presume that it is the same for other countries .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="106"> ten years of german unified eu participation are for us a history of solidarity must be now shared with others , even if the enlargement is not only a question of solidarity .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="107"> this tension makes the &apos; eee model &apos; reasoned because it rewards the candidates as soon as the application period .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="108"> after the horrors of two world wars and 50 years of oppression and communist dictatorship , during which have been trampled underfoot , on behalf of the class struggle , the dignity of man - universal as much as christian value- , democracy , religious freedom and the environment , it is time to unify finally our continent and this part of the world .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="109"> it must be made clear to all countries that entry into the european union does not directly entering economic and monetary union and access to the euro zone. the times are different .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="110"> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , yesterday , the president of the commission said during his speech that weakens a body of the european union weakens the whole of the european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="111"> mr president , it is with enthusiasm , and for my part with great interest , we are going to approve today &apos; today the reports on enlargement in the candidate countries , including the czech republic to which mr jürgen schröder has devoted his report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="112"> in my opinion , and i took advantage of the presence of a former irish attorney general to say , the commission has not yet demonstrated the determination required to settle this matter .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="113"> ( a5-0257 / 2000 ) by mrs paulsen , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on the undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition &amp; # 91 ; com ( 1999 ) 654 - c5-0344 / 1999 - 1999 / 0259 ( cod ) &amp; # 93 ;
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="114"> this is one point central and vital part of prevention work .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="115"> they cannot really have confidence if the control is subject to significant differences of a member state or region to another .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="116"> cannot sacrifice food security on the altar of the benefit of the agri-food lobbies , as for me , i have withdrawn my name from the report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="117"> during the establishment of the maximum values , we must keep in mind that nature has its own laws , that crops vary and that , ultimately , the farmer suffers , due to environmental effects on which it can have no influence .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="118"> we have addressed the same way all other areas related to the prohibition of dilution .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="119"> this directive is the first link in a long series of decisions relating to food security .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="120"> of course the zero risk is impossible . however , it is important to implement a warning system .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="121"> we do not dispute the paulsen report , we are absolutely in agreement with its contents .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="122"> the commissioner must know that , in my country , the independent advisory committee for issues relating to animal feed feared that a ban of this magnitude will cause a displacement of the blending operations outside the eu , where they are less likely to be well monitored and controlled before a future penetration on the market of the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="123"> i am delighted that the ppe - de has withdrawn its proposed amendment on the problem of the dilution .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="124"> in my eyes , &quot; from farm to the stall &quot; is the expression of the year in the field of eu consumer policy and suffers almost no competition .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="125"> unfortunately , in the future , criminal acts are not totally excluded , despite all our efforts .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="126"> mr president , this directive is an element of the package of coherent measures planned to ensure effectively the safety of all stages of the food chain .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="127"> should the legislation on hygiene is lacking in this regard , the review .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="128"> secondly , the commission cannot accept amendment no 27 by which parliament proposes to delete the possibility to define criteria of acceptability for material feed to the animals having undergone certain decontamination processes .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="129"> amendments nos 39 and 40 , which propose to delete the possibility of introducing limits of action , are also unacceptable .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="130"> the commission cannot accept amendments nos 5 and 22 relating to the system of early warning in their current wording .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="131"> the agenda is the report ( a5-0233 / 2000 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council amending directive 79 / 373 / eec on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs ( com ( 1999 ) 744 - c5-0020 / 2000 - 2000 / 0015 ( cod ) ) .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="132"> commissioner byrne , we are very satisfied .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="133"> producers have the burden of proving the composition of compound feedingstuffs for animals by providing detailed information to partially reverse the burden of proof in the event of application , but also to minimize the efforts of control within the member states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="134"> the issue of genetically modified cereals should be settled elsewhere than here .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="135"> the standards are hardly comparable and even less portable .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="136"> it &apos;s simple , but ten years turning around the jar of flour .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="137"> i am considering more critically the protection clause , which grant rights to the commission to take its own measures , without any consultations with the member states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="138"> accurate data is a second step , also necessary .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="139"> thus , within the council , a very large majority of member states is not in favour of the idea of mandating the systematic indication on labels , the exact composition of compound feedingstuffs for animals of report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="140"> madam president , i regret to inform you , you and the assembly , a new maritime tragedy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="141"> ( the president cut the speaker )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="142"> the text of recital in question would therefore be the following , and i quote : &quot; recital c ) whereas the situation of the roma is still not due attention , whereas discrimination of gypsies should be seriously taken into account by the hungarian government , through the adoption of a set of positive measures that could lead to assimilation free to individuals belonging to this community &quot; whereas it is appropriate to find a solution through the creation of an office for minorities and the adoption of legislation in the medium term , measures which will promote the integration of the roma into hungarian society . &quot; &quot;
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="143"> mr president , i just wanted to clarify that there is more to recital a but , in agreement with mr martelli , there a new article 1 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="144"> . j &apos; have voted against the report brok on l &apos; expansion of l &apos; european union , because same s &apos; he shows insight from the technical point of view , it obeys political misconceptions on l &apos; future of l &apos; europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="145"> the extension of the union , at least in a first stage , to more than 100 million new citizens , would give new impetus to the development and integration of the european economy as a whole .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="146"> his report clearly establishes the issues and objectives of enlargement in the field of regional policy , in both political and financial terms .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="147"> preparatory measures extending over long periods of time and transitional and specific regulations covering often many years were necessary .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="148"> we must provide an appropriate response to an enlargement which will greatly increase the number of disadvantaged regions , reflect together on the risk of accentuation of the imbalances in the european area in order to ensure that europe is not only a broad heterogeneous set .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="149"> so , where are the &quot; advanced &quot; for people who have never been consulted ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="150"> i am even afraid that this collection of reports on countries and cross reports prove counterproductive , especially in the countries which have applied for accession to the european union , in particular the countries of central and eastern europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="151"> and when i see what has been done so far on the subject at the intergovernmental conference , we cannot not particularly proud and we should firstly scan our own doorstep instead of demand on the part of the candidate countries to perform the first step that we are ourselves not able to accomplish .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="152"> this is the reason why , with my european colleagues of the national front , we would like to avoid the mistake of &quot; disintegration &quot; to the nations of eastern europe in the american-european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="153"> it is necessary to consider , as of now , new instruments and new forms of intervention for the benefit of all the areas which are reported deficiencies in infrastructure and networks of services such as , for example , the south of italy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="154"> it would be desirable that the governments of the candidate countries continue strengthening their administrative capacity , so that the acquis communautaire can be implemented in these countries as early as before accession .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="155"> and more than tedious accounting exegeses , it is this feeling - or lack thereof - that should determine our choices for enlargement when the time comes , because european construction has more meaning if it ceases to be primarily political .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="156"> i take this opportunity to greet the elderly and pensioners poland , some of which , moreover , are organized into a party of pensioners , analogous to the party retreats that i represent in the context of this european union .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="190"> mr president , madam commissioner , a part of the debate proves , in fact , that we here need a directive , because told it that europe mingles centralist way of an area that in the background should be the member states , and knowing what happened in the previous period in many countries of europe - yesterday still on television there was again a bunch of reports on attacks on jewish synagogues , on the rape of a woman of foreign origin , etc. it should still have the pellet to dare come to say that europe has no need for a directive to combat discrimination .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="191"> i have still two messages .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="192"> i think therefore that it is necessary to involve the public and private sectors , and in this sense , i believe that the public sector should set an example .

<p><seg id="198"> there are three categories of amendments .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="204"> in this sense , the titley report is particularly effective and highlights not only the merits but also gaps , limitations of the report which has been presented to us , as well as the feasibility of the code of conduct .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="205"> we always aspire to a regulation , which is more binding and more current view of developments on the market and in the arms industry .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="206"> mr president , despite its unquestionable merits , the report remains both technical and stands a security framework and a model based on the military force , which gives disproportionate weight to considerations of military industry .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="207"> on the basis of this consideration , i am advocating clarity : which criterion prevails in case of contradiction between the criteria put forward by mr titley ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="208"> the code has already strengthened the mutual understanding of the policies of the member states , it has established an efficient consultation mechanism and stimulated the dialogue about the implementation of its provisions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="209"> many of these projects are underway or under consideration .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="210"> by its resolution of 18 may 2000 , your assembly gave support to this project. its implementation is now launched .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="214"> there are new formulas to defend .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="215"> but on this subject , i would nevertheless like to say to parliament that it is important that this need , who spoke and who is an engine of economic development and innovation in this area , is taken into account at the level of the meda programmes and at the level of all external relations programmes .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="216"> and if i can &apos;t give you today &apos; response , is that i wanted to specifically , in this guidance note , invite member states to take a stand , because there is no european space research taking to the will of the commission .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="217"> in regard to the ecsc programme , know it that there was an agreement and that the search will continue .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="218"> i have accountable not only to the court of auditors , to taxpayers , but firstly to the european parliament , which is responsible for monitoring and approval of the budget and i think that &apos;s my role and my duty to say , at the moment that i considers it appropriate , what is happening , and to do so transparently , out of respect for the budgetary authority , that is the european parliament .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="219"> i believe that the ball is in your camp , your services provide , but they must be able to provide an answer .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="220"> i believe that , on the 102 spds which must be signed , 83 are currently under negotiation . i &apos;m talking about memory .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="221"> as the honourable member of your assembly has pointed out , the excise duties applied by the united kingdom on gasoline and diesel used as fuel are the highest in europe , but the excise duty on fuel oil and kerosene , insofar as these are used for industrial and commercial purposes or for heating these excise duties , as well as excise duty on heavy fuel oil , remain well below the highest values in the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="222"> therefore , i repeat , the commission has no way to ensure that the member states shall amend the level of excise duties .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="223"> the logic of economic reasoning supports the statement by mr. martin .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="224"> however , if he presented me a particular case illustrating its remarks , that of a particular region , or what do i know , i &apos;d love to advise my colleague mr barnier .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="242"> mr president , as others have already done today &apos; today , i congratulate mr titley for his report ,
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="243"> mr president , l &apos; the european defence industry is certainly important , but peace in the world &apos; is at least as much .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="244"> it is extremely disconcerting to see other european countries now involved in the production of arms .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="245"> the arms trade presents the singularity that these are poor countries that are mainly buyers , countries which , for n &apos; anything d &apos; other , do not find d &apos; money , but who are to buy weapons .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="246"> in its first report , the independent committee of experts pointed out that the internal control and internal audit were totally distinct activities - even conflicting- , which do not belong to the same department .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="247"> secondly , the european commission &apos;s proposal would require all institutions to appoint an internal auditor .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="248"> parliament has not yet received the official text of the proposal but we could see a preliminary version and although i hope that the full text will be soon sent to the parliament , i also understand the wish of the commission to ensure that the text is legally and linguistically flawless .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="249"> it is also important to retain the possibility of recourse to ex ante independent , structurally decentralized probably control , but that is certainly not subordinated to the director-general at the head of the branch that made the &apos; object of control .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="250"> however , until now we don &apos;t know anything , and as long as it will be so , i advise this house to accompany the process of reform of the european commission with a certain scepticism .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="251"> i believe that the committee on budgetary control held important discussions on this topic and the commission is certainly well-advised if it constantly on this skill in the continuation of his reforms .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="252"> unlike the internal audit , the classic financial control checks already budgetary processes until the contracts are signed and payments made .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="253"> there is a certain lack of interest , which i &apos;m certain that the commissioner will take good note so that we reach the faster the objective of this reform which the hulten report marks the beginning .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="254"> i would like to thank the two committees - the committee on budgetary control and the committee on budgets - for this debate of great intensity and the rapporteurs , mm . van hulten and dell &apos; alba , who could not be present today &apos; hui .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="255"> i find this proposal so wise that i regret that i do not have i imagined it .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="256"> it goes without saying that we pretend not to a harmonization of laws for the protection of minors , not only because , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , each member state is sovereign in this area , but also because the cultural and moral conceptions and , therefore , evaluations of these themes , differ considerably from one country to another . there is , for example , no single definition of the notion of a minor , violence , etc .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="257"> i believe that we must educate children to benefit appropriately from this media , and bring parents to teach their children to watch what &apos;s worth it and leave out the rest .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="258"> but it is similarly emphasized that it should not rely on the only implementation of filtering mechanisms to ensure a supply of selected programmes and also clear responsibilities programs broadcasters .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="259"> let me give you , by way of conclusion , the concern of the liberal group with a growing supply broadcasts involving violence and sex .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="260"> therefore it is essential that all parties involved , starting with the children and passing by their parents , educators , the countries , the european union , to finish with broadcasters and producers , shall consult on this topic and learn how it must behave and react to all these proposals and the effects they can have on people .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="261"> he is not here to generalize or to simplify , even if speaking time is counted in the european parliament , but there are multiple examples .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="262"> but subsidiarity must serve to do something , and not screen .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="263"> the aim of such a study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach , an approach based on the principles of self-regulation , and my services have launched work and have sent a questionnaire to the member states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="264"> no one has more respect than me for mrs reding and the staff she runs the committee . i am therefore sure that , when she will reply tonight , it will be able to clarify the points i raised and that she would not simply to deliver a prepared statement .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="265"> this is the reason why the question of researchers must be maintained , mr evans .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="266"> it is wrong , i think , that the commission in deprived .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="267"> i am very pleased that the rapporteur has taken account of the possibilities of the citizens of the candidate countries to be concerned by the recommendations on mobility .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="268"> despite some opinions of the courts , the recommendations of the auditors and actions at the level of the council , nothing has been done to resolve the situation of these readers , whose status has been reduced by the italian minister of education .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="270"> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you , firstly the rapporteur , but to all those who are committed , also in the competent committee and in this chamber , so that mobility becomes a reality .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="271"> our heads of state and government , regional and national governments , realized that education has a role to play if we want to develop the economy , if we want to develop the social .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="273"> once again , we will guide the fortunes of our continent , as had to do the great statesmen of the 1950s .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="274"> the european economic recovery is today &apos; hui a fact. therefore use the current weakness of the euro , which promotes an excellent competitiveness of our prices , to accelerate the rebound of productivity that innovation can generate both in instruments and modes of production and organisation of the market .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="275"> and this conquest is at this point that acquired consciousness that the there will weaken. now , two entire generations know only this europe of interdependence and open borders .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="276"> this emerging sector opens up women a more broad access to the world of work .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="277"> the second theme of this ministerial conference will focus on the articulation between family life and professional life .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="278"> firstly , the guidelines for employment which , this time , have been expanded with quantified targets . it is thus proposed to increase the employment rate of women to 60 % by 2010 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="279"> the expectations of civil society are strong , and this has not escaped the members of the convention who wished a &apos; correct anxious &apos; charter .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="280"> the participation of women on the labour market is very inferior to that of men , the difference increasing in some countries , especially in southern europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="281"> it is that i am a man ! but in the european union , men and women do not have the same chances of success .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="282"> this maybe deserves to be pointed out in this chamber .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="283"> mainstreaming has been repeatedly mentioned here and i can that associate myself with what has been said , namely , at the economic policy level for example , it is crucial that get to reflect on the man-woman aspect .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="284"> the woman , with a choice of nature , is one which covers the future of humanity in his breast .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="285"> it &apos;s well annoying all the same , these women who , from the bottom of their cuisine , their household accounts or refuse the bright future of the euro .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="286"> the report before us is based however on a forced interpretation of the principle &apos; equality .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="287"> l &apos; human being is a creature independent and responsible in its relations with god - its creator - and his ilk .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="288"> there are already three years ago !

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="292"> the women are forced into temporary work , more strongly exposed to precarious employment and unemployment , paid on average 30 % less than men .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="293"> this is why we need to assess the actual situation of women , we need to develop indicators , we must continue to give binding force to our political action , so that advances benefit all and not just some .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="294"> it is obvious , and the associative i - since me too , as much from between you , i have associative path 30 years - knows how many associative movements , feminist movements , intellectual movements , of course , worked to advance this matter , and we today &apos; today , we are at our place in our role of responsibility an institutional role .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="295"> i despair not anyway to improve this text .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="296"> i agree to the observations in the report and the suggestions of the members who have spoken of the need to change the nature of the report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="297"> mr president , commissioner , this morning we vote the common position of the council whereby we will definitely adopt this reform of the community customs code .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="298"> finally , amendment no 11 , which requested that this amendment of the community customs code enter into force before 1 january 2000 , has more sense .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="299"> i believe that , once more , the conciliation procedure , the agreement between the institutions , has worked well .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="300"> the community customs code has allowed d &apos; harmonize and simplify legislation in a transparent manner – which must always be l &apos; final goal .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="301"> if the &apos; considering the fragile balance that characterizes the folder , i think that l &apos; from a conciliation procedure - assuming that this debate be extended - would be somewhat uncertain .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="302"> mr president , on the last vote , i would like to simply inform the assembly of the fact that the commission issued yesterday , a press release and that commissioner reding has expressed last night in such a way that , with regard to the report that we have just adopted on the mobility of teachers , students , teachers and members of the educational community in general report to help them to travel to europe to study , work or carry out any activity related to the field of education , the commission will not accept any of the amendments asking him to do anything to ensure that these agreements are respected .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="303"> mr president , there is also a translation error that does not have the same scope as that which comes to be relieved .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="304"> we liberals support this fact - in the interest of a profitable operation of the internal market - the request by the committee to the commission so that the latter is developing a legislative proposal concerning the place of birth of the customs debt .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="305"> this proposal , if it is a step in the right direction in contains no less than many gaps which the evans report remedies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="306"> our position on the recommendation of the european parliament and the council about the free movement in the union is positive in principle , but we would like to mention the following :
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="307"> should be included in the association agreements which have been concluded or will have to be concluded between the european union and the candidate countries rules that prohibit discrimination of groups protected by article 13 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="308"> the usual principles of &apos; rule of law are thus gradually changed under l &apos; influence d &apos; an extremist conception of the fight against discrimination , to which the european parliament and the commission are too happy to rally to put their noses in all national laws .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="309"> it seemed essential to broaden the scope &apos; implementation of the programme to ensure the implementation of l &apos; article 13 of the treaty .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="310"> in addition , the snp sees this directive as a means to achieve the underlying objectives of the european union recognizing that equality in the field of employment helps combat social exclusion and participates in l &apos; intensification of the mobility of citizens within the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="311"> it is already very difficult for the authorities .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="312"> it is a very complex area and the proposals are both ambitious and far-reaching .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="313"> they also imply discrimination against persons and organizations considering the holy scriptures as the expression of the divine word , infallible rule governing anything , forcing these faithful to employ those who propagate and practise sexual acts in total contradiction with the ethics of the holy scriptures .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="314"> this distinction is detrimental to transparency of the financial regulation .

</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="384"> mr president , i think that there are still some problems , but we will have to solve them in the context of the vote on the amendments .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="385"> i would like to point out that each eu country has its own traditions and its own ways to solve problems that arise in social and employment policy ; the decisions taken at the lisbon summit acknowledge this fact .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="386"> elementary concern for the general interest should also encourage us all to approve the proposal to include recitals relating to employment in the regulations and decisions of merger , today &apos; hui laid down by competition .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="388"> in conclusion , the objective to give impetus to european social policy globalisation , enlargement and the ageing of the population is commendable .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="389"> our liberal colleagues , and in particular our british conservative colleagues , have again tabled a number of amendments , which will reduce the ambitions set out in the social action programme .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="390"> a wise and efficient policy mix economic and financial is crucial for us , and even more l &apos; extension of the social economy and the services sector .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="391"> all these coordinated actions of social policy will also fight against poverty and social exclusion .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="392"> sites open in the social agenda must benefit from a coherent legal framework , reconciling , certainly. the convergence policy and coordination policies open , but also pressing legislative measures , when necessary , themselves supplemented by perfectly demanding tracking methods .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="393"> it n &apos; is important not only to calculate the cost of social policy , often considered under certain political views , as an obstacle to economic development , but also to estimate the cost of the non-application of this policy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="394"> commissioner , thank you for your interesting speech .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="395"> the commission has now identified five areas for action that the is considered as having strategic importance .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="396"> we insist , at the same time , on the need for measures and d &apos; axes that complement each other in these areas of economic life , participation , representation on a foot of &apos; equality , social rights , civil society , the roles and stereotypes of both sexes .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="397"> this requires that we undertake in an intensive way in a women &apos;s policy that embraces the institutions and policy ; we must also move towards a greater adaptability of expected equality of opportunity policies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="398"> it is necessary to make the woman a place consistent with the vital importance of its mission , and i am not sure that mrs eriksson &apos;s report is contributing .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="399"> the cause of women can only be strengthened by such a decision .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="400"> we consider that the creation of a website is extremely useful , not only because of the increasing use of information technology , but also because this will help familiarize women with this new world which they cannot be excluded .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="401"> i hope that it will result in the necessary political impetus to the realization of the programme and the framework strategy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="402"> c &apos; is the well-known strategy which includes the five axes , namely the participation of women in economic life , at the centers of decision , social policy , civil society and human rights , and the new model d &apos; equality between the sexes in the media and in l &apos; education .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="403"> mr president , i welcome the report presented by the commission .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="404"> i understand , in the light of the latest developments , that the commission has decided to adopt a more hard - and rightly so - in respect of south korea .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="405"> this is important because of the need for transparency .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="406"> when taking a decision of competition policy , it must take account of its effects on the social , structural and industrial policy ; if it does not , it brings competition policy into pure ideology .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="407"> as you know , the commission is opposed to this merger , which triggered a wide debate on how to work the competition rules and how should calculate and estimate market shares .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="408"> mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , a cordial thanks for the reports we have heard today &apos; hui. they do not only state of the past , they give the themes of the current debate and already include the commission &apos;s plans .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="409"> finally , the strengthening of the individual responsibility of the citizen can create legal uncertainty , but a european competition policy must determine the behaviour and attitudes outside the institutions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="410"> in his report , mr. evans thanks you , mr monti , you be attacked with determination to the problem of state aid policy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="411"> this is why articles contained in the motions for resolutions and who put this aspect highlight , as well as a need for transparency , are particularly valuable .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="412"> i believe that together , we make steps forward to better explain this policy to citizens .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="413"> during the year in question , there were many cases that have required the use of a large amount of resources and which was completed by formal decisions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="414"> in regard to korea , mr lamy , who will come here later this week , will be better placed than me to get you the latest developments .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="415"> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i present today &apos; hui to the assembly , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , motion for a resolution on the report of the commission on the single facility providing financial assistance to medium-term balance of payments of member states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="416"> given the current integration economic , financial and monetary affairs , the probability that one or the other state member encounters difficulties in the balance of payments is extremely low from the institutional point of view ; however the mechanism shall remain in force .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="417"> the directive we are discussing today &apos; hui assures the maintenance and guarantee of traditional vine varieties , which characterize the cultivation of the vine in our regions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="418"> it will also tell us whether it intends to continue to prepare for the arrival of gmos on our plates and in our glasses , now unfortunately , with the complicity of the french presidency and total phase shift with european consumers .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="419"> i believe it is appropriate to approve the klaß report , especially after additional guarantees provided by the amendments , such as the committee on agriculture which specifies the reference to directive 220 / 90 , will be amended with regard to the aspect relating to gmos .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="420"> there , mrs klass , a second subject that angry .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="421"> if the were accepted this amendment , it would create artificial barriers to trade , which would be contrary to the main objective of the proposed directive , namely the consolidation of the internal market .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="422"> therefore , i consider that article 7 , paragraph 4 , of the rules of procedure has not been respected .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="423"> this is your legal mistake , madam president .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="424"> in the social field , i believe that we should also be able to move forward , on condition , however , do not touch the principles underpinning the various national social security systems , which leaves some room for manoeuvre .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="425"> by then , the preparatory group therefore met yesterday to work on qualified majority voting and on enhanced cooperation , on very concrete bases .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="426"> i heard the president-in-office of the council , mr moscovici , evoking what he called &apos; the biarritz spirit &apos; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="427"> we must reassure , say to those who are worried that under no circumstances is not rehabilitate cause the tax sovereignty of the states , say to those concerned also that it is not to merge social protection systems , especially at the bottom , but simply to function in an enlarged europe the common market and the single market .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="428"> it is for us an essential qualification so that the outcome of the intergovernmental conference can be characterized as a success , namely decision-making by majority to become the decision-making core principle in the future within the council of ministers and that the european parliament be treated as equals with regard to legislation in these various materials .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="429"> but there is a basic question that i would like to ask the president-in-office of the council to clarify .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="430"> in this sense , i would also ask that the is pronounced clearly on the proposal that we do and which , in our opinion , has a political meaning .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="431"> this assumes that the majority decision to become the rule in the council and co-decision with parliament must become the rule in the agricultural sector , for example .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="432"> me too , i wish the success of nice and i am delighted that european populations of numerous associations , ngos or trade unions , are investing in the prospect of nice .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="433"> this model in the context of the justice policy cooperation is already known .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="434"> in this regard , i do not share the feeling of the chairman of the group of the epp on the issue : &quot; a commissioner / a member state &quot; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="435"> i also refer to the number of meps in the european parliament .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="436"> how , in these circumstances , can we imagine that there is on it a trend ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="437"> this is why i believe that with the resolution that we will vote on tomorrow , we give a very clear mandate to our two representatives , elmar brok and dimitris tsatsos , allowing them to submit a proposal in this sense on the table in nice .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="438"> we friserions , it seems to me ridiculous . i hope that progress by nice can be made on this point .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="439"> unfortunately , france is more the interpreter of its own interests and those of the major countries that proposals to overcome the differences of opinion , although mr moscovici is now attempting to convince us otherwise .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="440"> i must tell you that article 93 , as drafted by the presidency , does not meet yet simple debate .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="441"> if the accepted european treaty in nice dull completely influence and representation of smaller member states , it will be very difficult to defend and to approve in referendums in these three countries .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="442"> mr president , mr president-in-office of the council , commissioner , about the situation in the middle east , two months ago , in this chamber , we were unanimous in welcoming the commitment to peace shown by avraham burg , the speaker of the knesset , and ahmad qurei , the president of the palestinian legislative council .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="443"> l &apos; enlargement , vision qu &apos; it was for some , has become a scarecrow , as s &apos; it would bring changes in the balance of power .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="444"> it is really disturbing that those who do not want to push reforms further that is allow the mandate given by their respective member states , are subject to what might be called a kind of blackmail .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="445"> mr president , during the last september plenary , we lived and shared moments of optimism and hope with abraham burg , speaker of the knesset , and abu ala , speaker of the palestinian legislative council .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="446"> i believe that it is appropriate that we have again today &apos; hui a common resolution , on behalf of all parties , in which we agree , wisely , that both sides need to make peace , that we cannot do as a people .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="447"> we are an opposition force and i believe that we have the right to vote on resolutions in favour of the charter , different from those of the majority .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="448"> this procedure is unacceptable from the point of view of democracy and integration policy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="449"> any other approach leads us into an impasse .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="450"> examples : the model european limited company , the painful liberalization and privatization of postal services at l &apos; community level , l &apos; opening the energy sector to competition , or l &apos; commitment to the process of &apos; harmonisation of taxation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="451"> all the same , we have made reference to the intelligent and open work leading to this charter and the national parliaments , representative of the national opinion , took part in this work .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="452"> finally , i would like to thank mrs randzio - plath for the speech made just now .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="453"> &quot; on our left , karl marx , the revolutionary thinker , denounced and rallying the idea of human rights , because the abstract man does not exist , according to him , and that humanity does not constitute anything .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="454"> thirty years ago , large countries of the south have suffered the dictatorship and east survived under the soviet yoke .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="455"> in any case , do not kill it today &apos; hui .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="456"> anyone who has studied the problem knows that &apos; there is an &quot; enigma &quot; of translations : while the italian version accepts the principle that island status is one of sufficient for the intervention of the community criteria , the french translation , followed by other languages , expresses a different concept and the english translation is exactly to halfway and lends itself to two interpretations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="457"> i come back therefore now on each of these points , but briefly to allow time for our debate .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="458"> i could just say thank you to olivier , and simply noted that there is , in its text , a quite low against president prodi attack - he speaks with humor , of course - or even noted that he did not quite say how he wanted that the is achieved in the constitution .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="459"> then there is , still , it &apos;s inevitable , but nevertheless questionable , a deal of arbitrariness , understandably , in the choices made by the institute in florence .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="460"> i understand that our italian friends - for many of them — are between the different language versions of article 158 , paragraph 2 , of the treaty , certain nuances , or differences , which may give rise to different interpretations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="461"> i fully share the parliament &apos;s wish that the fundamentals remain unchanged , but i noticed , president mr gil - robles , an opening on your part to relax some of these conditions , it is paragraph 11 of your resolution , and i want , in this regard , express some caution .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="462"> we need in the first phase of a constitutional treaty which synthétiserait in clear and understandable terms the fundamental principles of the existing treaties on which the european union is based .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="463"> it is with good reason that our rapporteur insists strongly on the requirement that the power of initiative of the commission and the participation of parliament , at least according to the consultation procedure , should be the norm in all enhanced cooperation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="464"> this work must not serve as a pretext for delaying enlargement .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="591"> in this context , i would like to plead in favour of cheap food products , those that buy families and that eat the children and youth .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="592"> secondly , the bowis report clearly indicates that the european food agency is responsible for the analysis of risk .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="593"> member states took the measure , as is the case of france , which has created a national food safety agency .

<p><seg id="596"> - ( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur , mr bowis , gave an excellent report and i would like in many respects confirm what he said .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="597"> we must apply to the field of animal nutrition legislation , directives and more stringent criteria .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="598"> i will therefore vote in favour of amendment 16 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="599"> the community is the largest importer and exporter of foodstuffs .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="600"> finally , it will be important to see how to reconcile its independence and transparency with , on one side , the uncertainty of the funds that will be allocated and its subordination to the commission , and , on the other , with its power of autonomous initiative and the composition of its board of directors .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="601"> however , the establishment of a european food safety authority contributes to some extent to a high level of health protection .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="602"> i have tabled an amendment which , in my opinion , is not devoid of significance , contrary to what mr whitehead , who claims that it is superfluous .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="603"> in my opinion , that alone will restore the confidence of consumers in a field of policy important both for producers and consumers .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="604"> now , the policy will be addressed in a coordinated and integrated manner and it will encompass the entire food chain .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="605"> that is why this food authority is necessary and that is why we him place , quite rightly , the necessary attention .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="606"> c &apos; is why i am in favour of amendments nos 14 and 19 , the purpose of which is to formulate principles that govern the choice of the place d &apos; implantation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="607"> c &apos; is in my opinion a reasonable attitude .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="608"> i would like to emphasise certain points in particular .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="609"> mr president , european food chain is one of the safest in the world but bad practices and recent scandals have imposed an agenda to which our commissioner , mr byrne , responded admirably .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="610"> we already have a multitude of organizations and institutions , as well as associations and initiatives , whose responsibility it is to ensure food security .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="611"> the own responsibility of consumers will always , despite the safety of the products .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="612"> probably not , says rightly mr blokland .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="613"> the parallel existence - and i stress particularly on it - the authority of food safety and the existing system of advisory committees has no place to be .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="614"> i would therefore urge the commissioner , at the time where one will pass to the series of legislative acts , to avoid the possible legislative excesses and red tape , particularly in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="615"> i hope that the new proposal will still of attention to these points .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="616"> indeed , the food authority is conceived as a centre of scientific excellence at the service of the community in the broadest sense : consumers , institutions and member states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="617"> this is quite normal and i agree with the parliament &apos;s wish to have recourse to articles 95 152 of the treaty .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="618"> obviously remains to be done and it is for this reason that we must welcome the commission &apos;s proposal .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="619"> in this sense , it must attach great attention to the problem and conduct awareness so that it is not forgotten .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="620"> the commission can and must also play a leading role in this area . it should tell us what it proposes to do about it also .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="621"> by our question , we would like to encourage the commission to persevere on this path and to strengthen this initiative .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="622"> i would also like to highlight the key role played by civil society , by highly motivated non-governmental organizations and , more particularly , by the actors of the international campaign to ban landmines .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="623"> we must admit the peculiarity of some countries .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="624"> turning specifically to the bonino report , i would briefly like to convey to you the comments of the committee on the very few amendments tabled by parliament that it is very difficult to adopt in their current form .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="625"> also looking for greater capacity and ownership at the local level , we must be able to take advantage of the know-how and existing equipment , the place where they are .
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="781"> this report contains a visa on the appeal of geneva against which the ppe group will vote , not because we are opposed to the geneva appeal , but simply because , as a parliament , we must guarantee good legislation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="782"> however , we must not forget to provide europol staff and adequate financial resources so that europol could effectively assume the skills that we transfer him .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="783"> this framework decision intends to combat serious crime , which is at the origin of money-laundering , and not against small crimes to the lower criminal implications , which could distort the objective of this framework decision if they were to be considered in this context .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="784"> this is where that states shall , through police and judicial cooperation , can intervene more effectively to combat organized crime .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="785"> however , to be honest , i believe that this initiative is not the ideal opportunity to adopt decisions in this area .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="786"> the table may seem dark , but it is permissible to hope !
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="787"> the report by mrs gebhardt emphasis on these three points .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="789"> also , like mrs palacio , we hope that this judicial cooperation unit will soon cease to be provisional , but , as radical members , we are not willing to renew the experience with europol , when the constitution of unity &apos; drugs &apos; gave rise to the creation of a super-agency in constant evolution and expansion , and escapes to the democratic scrutiny of national parliaments and the european parliament .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="790"> it must be based on commons and make assessments subject to broad political support .

<p><seg id="793"> the commission welcomes your report , mrs gebhardt .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="794"> and this follow-up work in fact precisely part , anyway , really a little late .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="795"> finally , in what regards the sin - which is my workhorse- , i assume that the three parties will endeavour to ensure a positive development in the future .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="796"> just to suggest that we need to re-examine the whole procedure , not only with regard to the annual report of the court which will be published tomorrow , but also in relation to the special reports such as this .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="797"> i would like to address a few points that are absolutely crucial , in my opinion , for the future work of control of expenditure on research in general .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="798"> i would , however , underline that no fraud or misappropriation have been observed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="799"> but i would nevertheless like to emphasize a point , it is that a joint financial responsibility is not possible strictly speaking in the context of the framework programme , which aims to set up consortia composed of different entities , universities , smes , large companies , public or private research institutes .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="800"> so the procedure is engaged , but we enter the field of jurisdiction of the member states , and there , we aren &apos;t always masters of the time .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="801"> approval of the minutes of the previous meeting
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="802"> madam president , let me first of all , as a member of salzburg , thanking you for words of consolation and comfort you found yesterday .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="803"> i think that , if we want that this charter is the cornerstone of a european constitution , it should be completed in the future .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="804"> this is obviously a major political decision and a new opportunity to show the citizens of europe the extent of this initiative .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="805"> the charter then is a quite coherent text .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="806"> i am sure that the members of the convention who will speak here will be able to confirm this .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="807"> well , i heard your rapporteurs wish again that the charter be the preamble to a constitutional treaty and we know that i , for my part , support. but i would remind you , because we are obliged to precision with regard to what is happening today &apos; hui to biarritz , the european council could say that a majority of member states were not prepared to discuss , at least for the moment , the incorporation of this charter into the treaties .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="808"> on behalf of our group , i would like to expressly thank not only all the members of my group but also , specifically , ingo friedrich , vice-president of the parliament , which had coordinated our work .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="809"> the european union is today &apos; today much more than an economic community .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="810"> this is our proposal .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="811"> it took several weeks of battle to include the right to strike .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="812"> secondly , it fills a gap in the protection of the fundamental rights of persons living in the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="813"> this is why we believe that the charter is important , as a position of principle , only because it launches debate. a debate which we consider useful for the future but that also still needs to grow , which must take place in parallel to the process of unification .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="814"> we can guess , behind the vote on the charter , a program aimed at building the first part of a constitution for what might be called the united states of europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="815"> however , we want a thriving , prosperous europe , a europe that grows . this is why we wanted to and had to refer to these roots .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="816"> this scope , i want to say a word .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="817"> combined with the prohibition on discrimination , respect is the foundation on which can rely , subsequently , measures to safeguard the position of minorities .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="818"> in life , nothing is perfect and the fact to declare rights but do not defend them effectively is not perfection nor .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="819"> it is never too late to do well .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="820"> the present charter seems to me to be a bad copy . it creates perplexity under legal profile , for example when it says , in paragraph 2 of article 2 &quot; no one shall be condemned to the death penalty &quot; - here , no problem- , and adds &quot; not executed &quot; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="821"> a note yet in the address by the president of the council : as a former member of a high court , i can assure you that the overlapping jurisdictions of different jurisdictions will very quickly create a divergent jurisprudence and that can therefore be expected to this divergence .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="822"> the reference in article 6 makes sense to me and i think that the presidency of the council must take note of mr baron &apos;s .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="823"> this is an important message to be issued at the present time , given the fragile political situation in one or the other member state .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="824"> this charter of social rights is a step backwards compared to the laws of many member states , and by this set of references precisely , will serve as an instrument for change or minimize .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="825"> mr president , the charter emphasizes existing rights , while making historic progress in europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="826"> mr president , the proposal and approval of the draft charter of fundamental rights should find a consensus broad enough .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="827"> attack further notes that trade union rights there are glossed over , and considers that the text , in essence , aims to establish the free movement of capital .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="828"> thus , this charter provides additional protection to the most vulnerable citizens of our european society , which is positive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="829"> first , they must include a reference to the charter in article 6 of the eu treaty .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="830"> for many years , the opportunity for the european union to accede to the european convention on human rights , as is the case of its member states was discussed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="831"> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the charter that we are preparing today &apos; hui to vote with europeanist conviction is certainly a step in the direction of the construction of a political europe in which we firmly believe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="832"> it is important not to destroy the authority of these two instances .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="833"> my colleagues in the committee on civil liberties have done me the honour to appoint me as rapporteur on respect for human rights in the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="834"> the charter included many supporters but also many enemies . we have listened to the criticisms of those who don &apos;t want a political europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="835"> for some the text was too stringent , or even too advanced compared to some reforms that would dismantle , and for others it would be empty or not sufficiently binding .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="836"> i would remind you that the these , for example , which was heard , represents 60 million employees in europe , that several hundred ngos were consulted , that citizens , quite simply , were able to deliver their contribution and that some of their proposals were accepted by the convention .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="837"> the vote will take place at 12 noon .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="838"> our parliament must , within this forum and during the discussions say very clearly to our turkish partners that they need not fear a any european desire to interfere in their internal affairs , but we offer them a contract being defined more precise , on the occasion of the accession partnership commissioner , and of course the convention on the charter of fundamental rights .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="839"> if it had wanted to place conditions , should have been the l &apos; last year l &apos; occasion of the earlier decision .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="840"> i believe that the excellent report by mr morillon testifies to the desire that is yours to carry out this process of pre-accession of turkey , while demonstrating a large and legitimate vigilance with regard to the still considerable reforms that this country has yet to commit .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="841"> mr president , mr president of the council , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by very warmly thanking mm . morillon and mr seppänen for their very constructive and reports advised on the political plan and say that this debate is taking place at a very favourable moment , at a time where we are indeed able to give a turn perhaps decisive contribution to relations between the union european and turkey .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="842"> i confirm once again that we must be concerned about compliance with inadequate rights of man and the rights of minorities , that we must be concerned about the role granted to the army by the constitution , that we remain deeply concerned about the situation of the population of kurdish origin and the state of emergency which is retained in the four provinces of the southeast of the country .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="843"> on this point also , i largely agree with mr morillon &apos;s report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="844"> given that this special program of 450 million , which the union will guarantee 65 % , specifies that on the basis of a provisioning rate of 9 % , the amount that should be transferred from the reserve to the guarantee fund amounts to eur 26 million , there are budget implications in the event of default of payment because it would appeal to the guarantee .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="845"> at a meeting at which i could unfortunately not participate , the majority of my group has decided to support the proposal of amendment 25 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="846"> the morillon report and the accession to the partnership committed the european union to turkey &apos;s candidacy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="847"> that is to say that i propose that the european parliament itself organising a debate on the armenian genocide , the majority will follow and we will extend the debate in turkey .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="848"> any other route would benefit those who in the eu and in turkey , don &apos;t want this membership .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="849"> mr president , the morillon report is , alone , perfectly developer of the fundamental contradictions of the european approach to turkey .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="850"> parentheses , there are a dozen days , the ultranationalist party mhp stated in all solemnity , at its congress , &quot; the superiority of the turkish race .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="851"> report ( a5-0279 / 2000 ) by mrs paciotti , on behalf of the committee on freedoms and rights of citizens , of the justice and home affairs , on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council on the protection of individuals with regard to the treatment of the personal data by the institutions and bodies of the community and on the free movement of such data ( com ( 1999 ) 337 - c5 - 0149 / 2000 - 1999 / 0153 ( cod ) )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="852"> i remember that entrusting this great power of control over databases european to a monocratic body - with all respect and confidence that we owe to the controller - seems to be a moment of inattention to the centrality of the human person which , faced with the power of information technology , must have a framework of rights and freedoms guaranteed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="853"> however , it is necessary to adopt a set of rules governing the protection of data , as institutions deal with not only internal data ( such as data relating to their autonomous activities , their budget and staff reports ) , but data on individuals collected in the performance of tasks of the european union ( for example also grants , surveys on competition cases , public auctions , work and statistical studies or data relating to the preparation and the implementation of legislative texts ) .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="854"> the charter of fundamental rights &apos; european union lies far behind the declaration of the rights of l &apos; man of l &apos; united nations or the european convention on human rights &apos; man , but also far behind number of constitutions of countries members of the &apos; european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="855"> we , the meps of the communist party of greece , are voting against the text which is not only unnecessary but also dangerous .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="856"> articles which tend to introduce unproven new obligations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="857"> sos democracy rejects the charter of fundamental rights for three reasons .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="858"> this is section 52 to which we feed the most concern. has the rights specified in other parts of the document can be ignored when they come into conflict with the &quot; objectives of general interest recognised by the union &quot; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="859"> and c &apos; is thus qu &apos; it will gradually permeate through jurisprudence , l &apos; together of our national and european rights !
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="860"> in addition , i would have preferred a charter not only on the &apos; rights &apos; of citizens , but also on the &quot; duties &quot; towards the company .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="862"> an also binary choice , my vote is unambiguous , it approves the progress that constitutes this charter , however very relative progress , both as to content and as to the scope of this text .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="863"> between the fact not to prohibit the access to work and the action to enable it , there is more than a shade .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="864"> doing so , however , it does not meet the ambition of the eu which is to be a union of peoples and of their citizens .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="865"> for the advocates of european federalism , this catalogue of rights is the embryo of a future european constitution , which the national constitutions of the member states will have to accommodate .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="866"> from end to end , its development has resulted in a series of shots of strength .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="867"> it is the lot of this so that d processes lead to texts that s &apos; necessarily aligned with the lowest common denominator .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="868"> the arguments put forward by the european parliament are quite spurious .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="869"> in all cases , the fight against money laundering takes place at various levels and we believe not in the need to define penal frameworks for this type of crime at the community level .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="870"> however , these practices are clearly going against the interests of humanity and the maintenance of our living environment .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="871"> this will constitute an important instrument enabling to bring criminals to justice , everywhere in europe .

</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="881"> our rapporteur , mr morillon , deserves our congratulations for having quoted the solution of the cyprus problem among the preconditions for turkey &apos;s accession .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="892"> there is indeed the dimension bilateral , difficult to negotiate , long to ratify , for the time being dominant , may shape more and more economies of these countries on the basis of their trade with the union , hindering the development of the south-south dimension , also because of the difficulties faced by partner countries to develop links of cooperation between them .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="893"> a few days ago , during meetings of the circle of economy of barcelona , the secretary general of the council , mr solana , we said that european external action priorities were , first of all , our neighbours . however , our first neighbours are the mediterranean .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="898"> mr president , to return to the conflict in the middle east , less than two months ago , the president of the parliament of israel and that of the palestinian assembly have , in this chamber , united their hands to those of the president of the european parliament to invoke peace and concord . meps there are united himself strongly applauding this gesture .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="901"> however , i wish to highlight two major political axes .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="902"> concretely , the reduction of their presence to the board of directors of the agency .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="903"> it is very important that ngos are involved , but also that they are evidence of a certain coordination if we want their action to be more efficient and that it extends across these regions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="904"> at the same time , to give content and meaning cultural , not in abstract or generic terms but in terms of solidarity , we introduced amendments which have received a favourable response in the committee on industry. in my opinion , these amendments allow to characterize , on the one hand , economic and civil aid and solidarity by the return of areas also affected a reality and a normal life , and secondly , a possibility of cultural and institutional solidarity - i stress this word : institutional - to make these regions feel related to europe , but also on the civilian side , in terms of cultural initiatives .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="905"> i also believe that we must avoid duplication of work between the board of directors and the board of management and meetings unnecessary and ritual of their members , while the manager must still take the necessary timely decisions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="906"> in one year , while the kosovo crisis is still fresh in our memories , much progress has been made , and the internal dynamics of several countries ultimately strengthens the role of the international community .
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="932"> commissioner , ladies and gentlemen a few , who have found the way to this chamber , i would like to first of all warmly congratulate the rapporteurs , and in particular the rapporteur here , for his work and for the very good cooperation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="933"> moreover , we shouldn &apos;t spend our money if the will to achieve the goals is lacking !
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="934"> i think qu &apos; they form a frame d &apos; political initiatives which need further development , so that we can bring new designs .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="936"> these two proposals respond to two key priorities for the union : provide assistance to southeastern europe and provide this aid effectively and as quickly as possible .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="937"> the european parliament can be also proud of these results .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="938"> to be clear , we can accept on the merits and provided that modifications be made in some cases to their formulation , amendments nos 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 and 7 , the first part of the 11 , the first part of 13 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 24 , the first part of the 28 31 and partially 37 .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="941"> finally , the leaders agreed to encourage an intensification of interparliamentary contacts , as foreseen in the context of cooperation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="942"> it is positive - i definitely want to emphasise this – that there was agreement on a framework programme for cooperation between asia and europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="943"> from the point of view of the fellowship program , we find incomprehensible that his secretariat has its headquarters in seoul .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="944"> this control must be transferred to a clearly community body to ensure that the common fisheries policy is applicable to all member states and to all vessels and professional regardless of their nationality , thus avoiding any risk of non-compliance with the principle of equality of treatment .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="946"> the development of the regionalisation of the cfp will be crucial for the implementation of local actions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="947"> we support the regional fisheries organisations , we ask that there is more regional organizations of fishing and that the commission be more weight .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="948"> we are in an extremely difficult position , which is to try to find a happy medium .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="954"> it is a proposal that the americans have already made them also .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="955"> this aspect is honest and credible . i would advise my group not to oppose the report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="956"> far from creating an exceptional system with regard to international practice , we approach instead , with this flexible mechanism , and at reasonable cost , prevention and management of crises , of what is practised in certain third countries such as income insurance in force in the united states and canada .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="957"> l &apos; future , non-compulsory regulation funds help , in my opinion , to balance the market in pigmeat as they l &apos; made in d &apos; other sectors .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="958"> mr president , that there are good in this debate , is that it highlights the common agricultural policy may regulate and what it cannot .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="959"> the evolution of market shows us that the pig cycle is still in progress , it is still a reality , and also that difficult times are place to better times .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="960"> in particular , we should not forget that , in many countries farmers fatten themselves piglets they produced , and thus have directly access to the compensation fund for the fattening pigs were sold .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="962"> since the last discharge procedure , the court adopted 24 special reports , that expose the results d &apos; audits involving &apos; focus on a wide range of specific areas in which the financial management of the community is likely d &apos; be improved .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="963"> this reflection leads me to make a few comments about the reform of the commission .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="964"> the court of auditors posing with reason for very discerning in l &apos; use of l &apos; money from taxpayers. the commission s &apos; based on these high requirements to reform the financial management .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="965"> l &apos; focus is obviously on the fact that &apos; it is the duty of the european commission d &apos; avoid formal errors and to fight fraud , d &apos; more qu &apos; one wonders still where the limits lie , and when things get confused .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="966"> the report by mrs schreyer was equally interesting .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="968"> told us that it is not possible to calculate them .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="969"> once and for all , we could say : &quot; this is the problems and we want to find solutions &quot; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="970"> member states protect themselves , they defraud , they neglect any form of control , and whenever critics rise , heads fall in brussels , that is to say the commission and elsewhere .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="971"> i appeal also to the ministers as well as heads of state and government so that they approve the proposal for the establishment of a european public prosecutor in nice .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="972"> the present report repeatedly speaks of procedures of management and adequate control , lack of planning , inadequate evaluations , eligibility criteria vague , or even non-existent .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="973"> i would like to thank the court of auditors to give its opinion on the reform of the financial regulation , quickly .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="974"> however , i believe that the court of auditors did not work well enough to be able to help us in our our task .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="975"> the whole process will take time .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="976"> this headline is based on a press conference by mr. friedmann and ask you , mr karlsson , why the members of the court of auditors made different statements depending on whether &apos; they s &apos; address to the committee on budgetary control or the press publicly .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="977"> i congratulate the commission and commissioner schreyer in particular ; the court has in fact pointed out that many of the changes requested are implemented or are about to be .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="978"> finally , while we proceed to all these changes in parliament , perhaps you could mr karlsson , go to the united states to assist in the counting of the votes !
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="979"> he was asked - as it was still recalled today &apos; hui repeatedly - that the court explicitly cited states in which fraud and irregularities have been discovered .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="980"> it &apos;s excellent quality documents , which are launching &quot; a pad in the mare &quot; of the common agricultural policy , which continues to favour big farmers at the expense of the smaller , countries and regions of central europe at the expense of countries and peripheral regions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="981"> i am extremely delighted .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="982"> on this point , it is quite clear that the court of first instance brought us his support saying that we had not only the right to mention these names but that also the duty us had .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="983"> thank you , mr president karlsson .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="984"> another paragraph that the you want to remove has relating to professional secrecy and said that professional secrecy must be subordinated to the effectiveness of control and monitoring of hazardous products services .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="985"> as a result , we have made another opinion here and the majority of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market can only advise the plenary to follow including amendments 38 and 41 , which mitigate prohibition d export .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="986"> an example : in many sectors , products are assembled by the manufacturer , but delivered in parts to the distributor .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="987"> in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , we voted , under the wise guidance of our rapporteur , a series of amendments that once again my group recommends that block assembly today &apos; hui .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="990"> in addition , the even the services lend themselves less .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="991"> mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur for his work , which meets the basic concerns of consumer groups , which should be accepted as valid partners in a constructive dialogue .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="992"> d &apos; other sectors , this directive has been extended to d &apos; other fields d &apos; application .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="993"> although the revision of the directive be formally provided for by the directive itself , this approach also reflects the will of the commission to strengthen the protection of health and safety of consumers .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="994"> this is also extremely important from the point of view of the industry , in order to maintain fair conditions between the different actors , in particular with regard to imported products .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="995"> the only novelty is that distributors must retain and provide at the request of the competent authorities , and within the limits of their respective activities , the documentation necessary to determine the origin of the products .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="996"> amendment 7 proposes certain changes in references to paragraphs .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="997"> it is aspects of civil law , regulated by the directive on the liability of products , which are therefore not to be treated here .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="998"> this is not acceptable , since these guidelines generally lack provisions for monitoring markets , reporting systems , etc .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="999"> this is not acceptable because it is a major step forward compared to the existing directive .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1024"> very quickly , a mediation has proved necessary because the council appeared unwilling to accept these amendments .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1025"> mr president , i share at least one certainty with the rapporteur , our colleague , mr blokland : incineration is perhaps a source of significant pollution , but it is actually today &apos; hui necessary , given the very low rate of recycling of waste .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1026"> primo - and more importantly - it will significantly contribute to the reduction of the emission of dangerous and polluting substances in the incineration of waste - very dangerous for the human health and substances harmful to the environment .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1027"> in some countries , the burning of waste , carefully sorted , in small communal plants of production d &apos; electricity and heating is also the best solution from the point of view of l &apos; environment .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1028"> in particular , i welcome the commitment to improve public access to information about the incineration plants and of the obligation of their operators to publish an annual report on emissions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1029"> l &apos; action of the portuguese and french presidencies was constructive and the commission deserves a special mention : she contributed decisively to l &apos; getting &apos; a satisfactory final result .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1030"> waste incineration is the final stage of the treatment of waste , according to the established hierarchy , and the commission will make serious efforts to reduce and recycle waste , as well as in its approach to integrated product policy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1031"> employment and social policy council adopted unanimously , in luxembourg on october 17 , a european strategy against social exclusion .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1032"> but they also proved necessary due to the increasing failure of these national systems of health , taking their public character and their higher cost , but also the limitation of their funding through state budgets , funding has steadily decreased in all states during the 1980s and early 1990s .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1033"> that is why , precisely , that it is so important - and this is the most important result of this report in fact - that the commission prepare short-term a green paper on supplementary health insurance .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1034"> the debate on insurance in the eu must not lead to an impasse .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1035"> according to this conception , the vocation of the complementary health insurance profit market is to take , so increasing and decisive , a complement to the public basic systems function .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1036"> these are the same doctors , the same nurses , the same hospital beds and the same resources of public health which appealed that the there is case to ordinary patients or people who pay their care .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1037"> my congratulations to the rapporteur michel rocard .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1038"> the social insurance for residents part escapes the coordination rules because it is not insurance for workers and it applies only to residents .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1039"> we reject this anti-grass roots reform .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1040"> health care are funded differently according to the member states and the role of private health insurance also differs .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1041"> our young charter of fundamental rights of the union european recognizes and respects through its articles 34 and 35 , the right of access to the benefits of social security and social services and at the same time proclaims that any person who residing and moving legally within the european union , is entitled to benefits from social security and benefits in accordance with community law and the national laws and practices .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1042"> funding regime of foresight as well as the pension scheme is at the centre of discussions on social but also budgetary policy in europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1043"> the restructuring of the systems of social security in several member states also contribute .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1044"> green books of today &apos; hui are unwelcome and damaging future legislation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1045"> the commission will immediately launch a study on supplementary health insurance .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1046"> i thank you for having understood that by this process we contribute to what the european union found a program in this area , despite its limitations and inadequacies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1047"> a person must also be placed in a situation such that it can acquire a qualification and adapt this qualification .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1048"> countries that are not members of the euro area present their convergence programmes , which are to a large extent similar to the stability programmes , the objectives they want to achieve are different .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1049"> finally , we consider how national budgets which are presented each year are compatible with more ambitious medium term strategies with regard to public finances .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1050"> in the case of finland , the public debt is already significantly inferior to this objective and shrinks in addition on an ongoing basis .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1051"> on the one hand , umts licences - as i said previously - allocated to debt reduction , which allows to obtain a public debt that is located almost at the level of 60 % .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1052"> inflation is undoubtedly a matter of concern .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1053"> i now feel that the formulae currently used in the respective member countries go in three directions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1054"> this action plan is implementing , as the government has set in the requirement , the primacy of public health and transparency .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1055"> this meeting allows indeed , at this moment , to compare experiences and approaches on testing programme , on the prohibition of animal meal and other provisions likely to be strengthened at european level .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1056"> we have seen a worrying increase in cases of bse detected in france over the past year , in part because of the introduction of random testing .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1057"> finally , we must not underestimate the enormous progress made over the past years , the last year in particular , by setting up a framework for combating bse .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1058"> the european parliament has always been a strong supporter of these tests , and i count on you to lend your support to the commission &apos;s approach .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1059"> a strict application of these controls is therefore necessary , both in terms of public health as financially .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1060"> my only concern about the use of animal meal is to know if they have or not a risk in the context of animal feed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1061"> it remains to be seen if the recent events have altered that opinion .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1062"> ( applause )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1063"> i would like , madam president , that this is my last speech on this subject in this house , because we really must put an end to this problem .

<p><seg id="1069"> ( applause from the uen group )

<p><seg id="1070"> even if there is a decision from france , its repercussions extend far beyond french borders .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1071"> the health of european consumers must be considered an absolute priority in all decision-making .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1072"> a general ban on the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs of all animals , that is to say , also in pigs , poultry and fish , as demanded by some member states and some of my colleagues , is not scientifically justified .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1073"> madam president , i would like to ask the commission to be less categorical when she takes position , especially when it makes predictions for the future .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1074"> yesterday , the coordinators of the different parts of the committee on agriculture and rural development agreed on the proposal to devote to the fight against bse 600 million eur 1.3 billion reserve that remains of the agriculture budget .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1075"> everyone recognizes that bse , originally british presented today &apos; hui as a french crisis , is actually a european disease , a european problem , and that it should be treated accordingly .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1076"> we must take precautionary measures now , not only on behalf of those of us who are concerned , but also on behalf of the minority of &quot; sufficient &quot; member states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1077"> and tomorrow , with the banning of meat and bone meal , these are millions of additional hectares of culture oleoproteagineuse that will make us default .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1078"> i did a quick calculation of the cost : it is 10 cents per kilo .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1079"> it &apos;s an endangering consumers premeditated and it cannot be tolerated .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1080"> the parliament vote half the budget to encourage production .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1081"> moreover , this regulation is constantly the subject of improvements and adapts to the requirements of europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1082"> however , our country has learned , over the years , on how to restore order in its affairs .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1083"> france comes to prohibit the consumption of rib on the bone and many french regions have withdrawn french beef from their canteens menu .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1084"> i believe that we must , today &apos; hui , try , after your discussions , clear strong lines , both on the method on the means to ensure this imperative .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1085"> we are talking about public health , so serious events that it is important to treat as such , with rigour and probably with transparency .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1086"> i believe that the legislation has been respected , and i do not think being naive , but i do not believe that it is essential to impose a general ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry .
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="1097"> so we will have a base of most common understanding , because it is not easy to define the concept of social exclusion .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1098"> it would be useful to use a portion of the increase in funding called for in this report to finance comparative studies on how these elements could be managed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1099"> for my part , i think that poverty and exclusion are secreted by our company , and that we are collectively responsible .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1100"> in order to achieve economic and social cohesion desired , we need , in addition to a level of high employment , a high level of social protection .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1101"> the fact is that social exclusion is a brake on economic growth while a society based on inclusion promotes the growth and well-being of everyone .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1102"> naturally , the management of the labour market policy is part of this fight .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1103"> mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent contribution to the identification of the causes and the dimension of poverty , adapted to a social reality whose cruelty is not diluted in a concept as vast and abstract than that of social exclusion .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1104"> the proposed action programme has a legal basis , article 137 of the treaty of amsterdam , and the lisbon council told us a new mandate .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1105"> but i agree that the term &apos; poverty &apos; is politically very strong a word and i agree to be associated , where possible , to &quot; social exclusion &quot; in the text of the proposal .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1106"> finally , i would like to address your concerns regarding the involvement of different actors and institutions in the implementation of this programme .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1107"> the proposal for a directive is a logical consequence of the strategy of the european union aimed at doubling the share of renewable energies in the consumption of energy by 2010 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1108"> in this regard , member states have the possibility of calculating the exact amount of their respective contributions to the achievement of the objectives of the union based on the principle of burden-sharing , and i would say also in this field of the sharing of opportunities .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1109"> it is a summit that intends to curb climate change and where the kyoto protocol will pass its test of fire .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1110"> renewables are by far the most important source of energy currently used in the world .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1111"> however , these subsidies must in my opinion remain reasonable and n &apos; be allocated only for a specific period .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1112"> that is , being political , making it possible to a competition between the two instruments by protecting guaranteed prices and harmonising everything certificate .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1113"> c &apos; is the reason for which j &apos; have tabled an amendment to apply to l &apos; d &apos; emission &apos; standards strict l waste incineration annex 5 of the revised directive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1114"> many of us believe that energy from waste should be included .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1115"> in my opinion , the promotion of renewables must &apos; accompany d &apos; a modern programme d &apos; economies d &apos; energy , because this dependence is also beginning to represent for us a security risk .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1116"> similarly , i wish to inform the commissioner that ireland will , in the very short term , be competitive in wind energy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1117"> the debate on renewable energies should not turn into a populist campaign against &apos; nuclear power .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1118"> l &apos; commitment of authorities is indispensable if we are to receive funding for all everyone .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1119"> renewable energies are not exception .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1120"> this is what we do at european level .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1121"> mr president , i would firstly like to congratulate mrs rothe for the splendid work she has done and all the members who have spoken and who have in addition amended repeatedly included text that was proposed to the parliament and the council .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1122"> the commission rejects this part of amendment no 27 and amendments nos 11 , 54 , 55 , 61 and 57 relating thereto .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1123"> with regard to the principles on which the future harmonised support scheme should be based , the commission can accept parts of amendments nos 37 and 38 which stipulate that this regime must take account of environmental objectives of the treaty , of the experience gained from support schemes which have proved that they were effective and positive , as well as geographic data .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1124"> the war widows are forced to raise children on their own , to deal with the elderly only .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1126"> there are instead of acting preemptively against this kind of situation by offering women in the refugee camps , special protection through the division of the camps .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1127"> finally , mr president , i would like to express my disappointment about the manoeuvres deployed in l &apos; shade that have d &apos; weaken paragraph 12 concerning the rights and freedom of choice of women victims of rape and war situations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1128"> let us be practical .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1129"> we cannot allow this to continue because the rights , priorities and interests of women are too often ignored in the peace negotiations. and because in the rare cases where women occupy decision-making positions in these areas , they are extremely effective .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1130"> j &apos; have personally identified some priorities .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1131"> i am convinced that if women , palestinian and israeli , had their say and their role in the peace process , a fair and lasting solution could be found , in all likelihood , to the palestinian question , and we would not face the current crisis , which is the result of seven years of fruitless negotiations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1132"> mr president , mrs theorin &apos;s report contains many bizarre elements , and it seems to me that we should not give the impression that the armed forces are a kind of social service and that their main concern is to be politically correct .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1133"> mr president , tell me that the council currently represents , or the high representative for the cfsp .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1134"> create oppositions between the sexes , as it is applied this evening in this house , in my opinion is an approach that is neither peaceful nor constructive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1135"> mr president , it is certain that we are in a phase where gender , participation of women , begin to make their appearance in different programs , when they do not become the rule .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1136"> so , i think that these two ways come into consideration for a universal study of the issue and examine the attempts in some countries .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1137"> in some cases , they are exploited and abused .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1138"> i &apos;ll review some of the objections .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1139"> it is also argued that this would create a class at a discount on the labour market .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1140"> in austria , and especially in my region , is applied for three years a project funded by the eu , through which advice for women is very successfully as an intermediary for domestic helps .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1141"> now that the dark pages of the last decade are rotated , your presence before this house reflects our common desire to see yugoslavia recover very quickly its full place in the european family .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1142"> but , today &apos; hui , after startle policy decisive 24 september or the still more decisive on 5 october , yugoslav foreign policy has set an objective , the adoption of a global approach to the group of nations that make up the european union , followed by accession .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1143"> the most important to accomplish now task is the establishment of a network of democratic internal relations in the federal republic of yugoslavia .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1144"> a common democratic state allows muslims and albanians in montenegro and serbia to live in the same state and allows us to join forces to build our common egalitarian state .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1145"> thank you very much , mr president , of this intervention which , as you can see , has impressed our assembly .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1146"> mr president , on page 27 of the annex to the minutes , it takes note of my vote in favour of amendment no 20 of the morillon report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1147"> my goal throughout the drafting of this report was to put forward a proposal that is politically mature , eminently reasonable and practical , both for the institutions and the citizen .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1148"> another important amendment is that on the proposal to include in the regulation not only the council , the commission and the parliament but also all external instances .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1149"> c &apos; is also a very good thing that the institutions are imposing , or rather that l &apos; given the opportunity to communicate documents to persons inhabiting n &apos; not on the territory of the &apos; european union or who are not citizens of l &apos; european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1150"> this is why the text of mr cashman is not any report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1151"> unfortunately , the wish that had some to prevent all eventualities and to provide the most comprehensive regulation and the widest possible was probably stronger .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1152"> mr president , many intelligent things were said about the context of this report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1153"> mr president , the cashman report can be summed up in a few words : the power of citizens on the bureaucracy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1154"> this is a point on which parliament took position favorably , and on which he will certainly give emphasis , because it is important .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1155"> it must now , in our negotiations with the council and the commission , for us to point a proposal and that we reach a result .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1156"> according to what told it this legislation on public access to documents has barely been discussed in the college and there was regarded as an essentially administrative matter so far .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1157"> it is the rights of the citizens we serve this time .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1158"> we , the members of the bonino list , we consider , at the same time , that the should not fall into the opposite excess in imposing a hyper-reglementation which would introduce an indiscriminate access to information or opinions which have no intelligence value .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1159"> this point of regulation opens the door to arbitrariness .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1160"> they say one thing , but it is another .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1161"> the stakes are judicial security , administration and efficient democratic operating mode .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1162"> this is an aspect to which we have to keep , especially as parliament .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1163"> we certainly need a new era of information and a great opportunity is offered to us , to us parliamentarians , to show our true face .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1164"> in fact , it is important for the security itself that citizens have the opportunity to assess their confidence in european defence based on facts and documents .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1165"> j &apos; conclude that the board erred , in july , serious stating that all military documents were strictly confidential .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1166"> the fundamental principle is the opening , but it must be reconciled with the safeguarding of the public interest and respect for certain rights which deserve special protection .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1167"> compel the institutions to disseminate these internal notes could produce , in many cases , as some confusion among citizens .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1168"> at this stage of the legislative procedure , it is premature to adopt a position on the advisability of a direct relationship between the classification and access to documents , as proposed in amendment no 29 , or of the inclusion in the regulation of standards for this purpose .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1169"> mr cashman is right when he says that this is not the commission to tell the political groups what position they take here in plenary .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1170"> i would like to stress the key role played by the parliamentary commission joint eu - malta in ongoing negotiations for l &apos; l joining &apos; eu of the republic of malta .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1171"> we do however not give banks the right to determine themselves their capital requirements but , in practice , we would be very close to do if we do not keep an it attentive on their internal systems .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1172"> ( pt ) mr president , i would like to report to the plenary that the amendments contained in the name of gue / ngl , i present as rapporteur , are derived from conversations with the council and the commission , and also benefit from the support of the coordinators of the political groups represented in the committee on employment and social affairs .
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="1175"> mr president , unlike mrs theorin , i do not want to suggest that we move the votes and debates at the discretion of the conveniences of my personal agenda .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1176"> i am one of the parliamentarians who are rather honorably present .

<p><seg id="1180"> the union as a whole must mobilize because it would not be acceptable that a country should take drastic action and put its economy in danger , while others would continue to pursue their activities normally .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1181"> the cap has always promoted the intensification of production or the progressive &quot; verticalisation &quot; of production and the concentration of the earth , to basically serve the interests of the food industry and large food multinationals .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1182"> it is also an attitude of distrust towards the european union which , in their eyes , is not able to guarantee the safety of food products entering the market .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1183"> i would like to recall the decisive role played by our group uen for qu &apos; it could take place , as well as very consistent resolution that we tabled .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1185"> still , the parliament insisted successfully on another point : facilities where radioactive waste is incinerated must be expressly excluded from the scope of the directive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1186"> i am absolutely convinced that , in ninety-nine percent of the cases , it is the governments of our 15 states that bear the responsibility of social exclusion and poverty .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1187"> but , unfortunately , good intentions do not a policy , not of denunciation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1188"> too many of our fellow citizens are left by the wayside .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1189"> europe cannot be economically strong only if it is socially just , we can only welcome this progress .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1190"> it would be more effective to combat exclusion , for example create a guaranteed european minimum wage .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1191"> with a new , radical approach , i firmly believe we can not only pass this critical time cape , but also reach our final target and , one day , eradicate fully the poverty and social exclusion in the northwest .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1194"> i therefore thank mrs rothe for the quality of his report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1195"> this is especially true for people who do not have the means and which , as such , have to first concern to ensure that their household expenses remain as low as possible .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1196"> the agenda is the debate on topical and urgent and of major importance .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1197"> we disagree only on item 5 of this resolution , but this is not a critical divergence . it seems to us that in approving this point parliament adopted an excessively paternalistic attitude .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1198"> we believe , not only now , but since the creation of the parlacen , that of some seek to diminish his skills , to weaken its presence , because a parliament is always annoying , but i believe that the vocation of parlacen , in the same way as ours or that of other parliaments , is to be beneficial for the people it represents even if it is inconvenient for the established powers .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1199"> it is one of the issues which , obviously , an almost unanimous feeling , not only in this house but also among many members who due to their origin , observe with great sympathy the process of collaboration and consolidation of the institutions of countries that we consider ours .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1200"> in our cooperation with the region , we have paid special attention to all the institutions that can support regional integration , the general secretariat of the system for integration of central america , the court of justice and , more particularly , the parlacen , which is one of our priority objectives .

<p><seg id="1207"> mr president , the european union has recently denounced in various statements , the excesses of the regime of general gueï and also deplored the direct exclusion of the main opposition candidates from the elections of 22 october , exclusion which has limited , in large part , the credibility of the electoral process .

<p><seg id="1210"> in fact , as already noted , the situation in burma is being worse . it is incredible that a democratic leader as important as aung san suu kyi continues to be the subject of persecution and that the democratic league cannot perform duties normally to restore democracy , and even more so when this country continues to benefit from economic investments that benefit , specifically , the lack of freedom , the absence of trade union rights .

<p><seg id="1405"> there has been since then , alas , many other maritime disasters , we do know only too well .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1406"> thirdly , we say , and we are not , far from it , the only ones to do so , that a dangerous ship should not simply be held dockside to then be allowed to return to sea .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1407"> i would add that l &apos; initiative of the commission to present this position was important because it played like a sword of damocles , as effective pressure on l &apos; imo in sight d &apos; lead .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1408"> on the other hand , inspections will be imposed only where they may be carried out by specialized and exclusive inspectors cannot have no relationship with the owner , and that the latter does not control the vessel &apos;s classification body .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1409"> furthermore , although the direct dumping of industrial materials , including the disposal of military munitions in question obsolete , is a practice that has been largely abandoned by member states , these munitions and industrial materials continue to represent a real threat to the industry of fishing and in some cases a threat to the safety of the men .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1410"> the cooperation includes the exchange of information and the survey of munitions disposal sites .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1411"> vigorous action must be conducted on the issue of flags of convenience , which , for example , that of the kerguelen for france , and against ships who were beaten during the 36 months preceding the &apos; adoption of these guidelines , the pavillon de l &apos; state in table capital and above-average delays published in the annual report of the mou under the heading &apos; blacklist &apos; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1412"> so please accept this proposal !
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1413"> this is why i ask in my turn to finish as quickly as possible to the council .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1414"> if a flag state remains in default , l &apos; port state must in this case receive more responsibilities .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1415"> eight thousand ninety thousand boats that sail on the seas around the world are below safety standards and four thousand transport dangerous goods .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1416"> l &apos; maritime insecurity , many players point out , is largely due to deregulation and practices of convenience .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1417"> how can we , in full french presidency of l &apos; union , explain to our citizens that the european parliament has deleted measures d &apos; incentive and financial deterrence proposed to accelerate the transition to double hulls .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1418"> concerning the responsibilities of l &apos; state of the port , the one cannot continue to underestimate the tasks of the port authorities .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1419"> i know it &apos;s the maximum text that the council can accept , but we will not contribute to its adoption in the hope that it will be improved at second reading . we will vote however not against because we recognize the excellent work done by the rapporteur , mr ortuondo , who by some compromise amendments show us the path to follow in the next reading .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1420"> it s &apos; were in the first place l &apos; erika , but at the same time , a tanker was sinking further , off the coast of turkey specifically .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1421"> i now have a few brief comments to make regarding the monohulls .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1422"> we have the political and economic means to impose and enforce our choice .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1423"> we need a comprehensive overview of the responsibility of all stakeholders .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1424"> it also concerns the specifications of double-hulled vessels .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1425"> maybe then , we could avoid a disaster .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1426"> this is , i think , l &apos; balance which can be obtained on the basis of the proposals of the commission and l &apos; imo , as well as reports to l &apos; review where colleagues who are the authors deserve congratulations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1427"> the proof is that the measures adopted at the international level to improve safety and reduce accidental pollution have had some success .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1428"> classification societies shall be evaluated using common criteria : number of accidents , incidents or detentions of inspected and certified , ships which are at the origin of pollution .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1429"> when the ievoli sun sank , the boat was young , relatively , double-hulled , l &apos; crew is community , and the italian pavilion .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1430"> but what is most important , c &apos; is the fierce determination that must animate us collectively to change the current rules of the game of maritime transport in order to roll back l &apos; maritime insecurity .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1431"> most of the amendments focus on the refusal offered access to community waters .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1432"> number of between them , either do not concern the control by the port state , are already included in this directive or other directive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1433"> for similar reasons , the commission cannot agree with the new amendment no 22 , which refers to the essential subject of the safety of navigation but has no place in the proposed regulations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1434"> i share the concerns of the parliament , which insists on the fact that an owner of ships should be able to exercise any undue influence on the classification society .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1435"> secondly , as part of our proposal erika ii relating to the monitoring of navigation , the member states will be obliged to intervene , even on the high seas , in similar cases .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1437"> ( parliament approved the commission proposal )
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1444"> if we had thought about earlier , if mr hatzidakis had been here before , in recent years , it would have certainly proposed double hulls for ships and we would have avoided many disasters .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1445"> the risk of maritime collisions is so high that , without additional support and control , the risk of accidents from the sea would probably cease to increase .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1447"> in the case of the erika , local fishing and aquaculture industries have been hit hard , and it is important to not only consider the tragic consequences observable directly after the disaster , but also see below and take into account the adverse effects in the long term of the oil pollution .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1449"> in addition , the training of the inspectors of these companies varies d &apos; country to l &apos; another .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1455"> with regard to the extension of qualified majority voting , i don &apos;t think that it is a sensible proposal , because it would intrude on the right of the member states to take a decision in a timely manner on the communitarisation or non-communautarisation of a policy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1456"> proponents of l &apos; liberal europe , not only n &apos; that extend the misery of peoples already crushed by poverty , but they are , on this occasion , a political project : formalize a pole of rich countries that controls an expanded european market .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1458"> our debates in this house look more like monologues successive qu &apos; real exchanges .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1459"> i am opposed to the development of a common defence policy and the establishment of a council of defence ministers .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1460"> we believe that this transformation of the commission into delegations of the european community delegations could induce to conflicts of interest with the national diplomatic delegations in our various countries .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1462"> the five danish liberal members of the european parliament have today voted for the lalumière report on a common security and defence policy , because we support a strengthening of the capacity of the member countries of the eu and , at the same time , to that of nato .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1480"> madam president , the nice summit is particularly important .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1481"> with regard to substantive considerations , i give just an example .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1482"> we believe that this report should be comprehensive and , therefore , ask to be able to discuss and put to the vote in january .

<p><seg id="1488"> but , ladies and gentlemen , if you actually had awareness of tobacco-related health problem , you would require the banning of this drug , as you continue to maintain that other substances yet quantitatively much less deadly .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1489"> also , amendment no 2 on carbon monoxide is especially important .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1490"> history teaches us , in this regard , that it is dangerous to consider goal - so noble and so virtuous it can be - superior to the rules laid down .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1491"> mr president , i would like to take the defense of workers in this sector .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1492"> and , despite my absence , it is obvious that my vote was going in this direction .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1493"> therefore , my concern at present , does not so much on health problems , which are of course important and considerable , on restrictions that would imply our acceptance of this very restrictive interpretation of the legislative power of the european parliament .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1494"> mr president , if this proposal actually becomes a law at the end of the second reading , it will cause a limitation of the freedom of companies d &apos; a share and increased public d health protection &apos; on the other hand .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1495"> the results of the research in this area are so clear that we cannot , as european legislators , not to follow these tips .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1496"> following the decision of the court of justice of the european communities , the commission then adopted again this position - and this time with a large majority .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1501"> this directive was introduced to take into account the conclusions of the valverde lópez report of 1997 of the european parliament , which already mentioned many of the elements that the found in the present text and called for a proposal from the commission .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1502"> that is why the need to regulate - in the interests of the consumer - is clear .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1503"> in this regard , let me say that from the point of view of international and community rules , there is no exception for registered trademarks in measures taken for the protection of public health , and more particularly here , where the effects on the behaviour of smokers are so large .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1504"> this is related to the question of access to the products , in particular when distributors are located in areas without supervision .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1505"> summer time
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1506"> there are other issues that we would like to analyze , such as consumption of energy , health and safety , because they report to summer time ; but the strongest argument is without any doubt we want to give the opportunity for the new members to comply with our provisions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1507"> madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i note once again that the advantages and disadvantages of daylight saving time give rise to extensive discussions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1508"> our group believes that the proposal which has just been made is good . it supports it and is d &apos; opinion that further amendments are not necessary .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1509"> another problem exists in agriculture : in autumn , during the beatings , l &apos; time indicates that morning moisture should have disappeared . gold surprise , nature does not comply with the directive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1510"> with regard to the amendments proposed , the commission gave its agreement with amendments nos 3 and 4 , the purpose of which is to make the system more transparent and to insist on the precautionary principle .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1511"> according to the european parliament , the compromise on which we we have agreed greatly improve the common position of the council .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1512"> children receive drugs that have only been tested on adults , which means that children are badly treated .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1513"> it can help improve clinical research in europe and therefore the well-being of millions of patients .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1514"> this compromise , which can of course still be surpassed by each member state establishes a minimum threshold to prevent the european union from a kind of ethical dumping that would give the possibility for a member state , but not to others , to conduct research on persons incapable of giving their consent .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1515"> finally , and in this respect j &apos; expressed my dissatisfaction that this provision n &apos; has not been retained in the council &apos;s compromise proposals , i think that l &apos; investigator principal charge of the conduct of clinical trials should be a doctor. because only physicians have knowledge and l &apos; experience enabling d &apos; evaluate the benefits and mitigating adverse effects and risks in these trials .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1516"> the agenda is the report ( a5-0377 / 2000 ) by mr trakatellis , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a decision of the european parliament and of the council extending certain programmes of community action in the field of public health adopted by decisions 645 / 96 / ec 646 / 96 / ec , 647 / 96 / ec , 102 / 97 / ec , 1400 / 97 / this and 1296 / 1999 / this and amending those decisions ( com ( 2000 ) 0448 - c5-0400 / 2000 - 2000 / 0192 ( cod ) ) .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1517"> perhaps , i would add , we inaugurated a new mode of operation for codecision .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1518"> this is precisely a problem about which we believe that the there is the weakness of the orientation of the union european , the council and the commission which , with budgetary restrictions , reaching the ceiling of 1.27 % currently allowed by the standards in force , is that actions such as these are permitted while coordination between the various member states is increasingly important .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1519"> this is an area that can be taken into account in the context of the new community public health programme to be launched soon .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1520"> the text that we are adopting today &apos; today on the extension of six public health programmes reflects the informal agreements between institutions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1521"> all of these factors , acting independently or joint , which multiply their effects , make that every day , naturally , millions of people cross the borders of their state of residence to move to other states of the european union , to live , work , study or simply travel .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1522"> the european union cannot accept that given different treatment according to the member state where they have been victims of the offence or their nationality .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1523"> we should therefore ask ourselves if there is justification to approve this project .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1524"> indeed , we cannot seriously talk about a europe of citizens without taking into account the rights of the victims .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1525"> the liberal group believes that a very good report emerged from the discussions in committee , and will therefore support the amendments from the committee at the time of the vote .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1526"> l &apos; compensation of the victim must have priority over the payment of fines and costs of justice l &apos; state .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1527"> i welcome the proposal of portugal also improve the position of victims in criminal proceedings , even if i completely respect views on legal character which have been previously exposed by mr lehne .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1528"> which would therefore participate , particularly by the vote , in a democracy that would leave aside the problems ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1529"> several amendments refer to the official languages of the european union , providing for the right for victims to communicate in one of these languages .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1530"> as i have already said , the commission , continuing the follow-up to its communication of 14 july 1999 , is working on the adoption of concrete measures of assistance to victims , in particular through the support envisaged in the european forum for victim services .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1531"> we acknowledge it .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1532"> i believe that the institutions , and in this case the commission , should work with more serious proposals get to this house on time and so the could appoint a rapporteur , examine the proposal from the commission , submit amendments , debate in committee , and , then discuss in plenary. are we asked to do so in a single plenary session , which is impossible .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1533"> we didn &apos;t have any at the outset of the budgetary targets to which we subject our policy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1534"> the thing that has us constantly , the tormented throughout the budgetary procedure , it was the financing of our external actions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1535"> or that my successor as rapporteur-general of the parliament and the presidency of the council , which will return to belgium in the second half of next year , i wish already lots of fun during the negotiations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1536"> i would also like to clearly say : we in this parliament a number of vacant posts which , year after year , savings totalling tens of millions of euros , so we must ask ourselves if we still set our budget in a correct manner .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1537"> another reason to treat this theme to their knees is perhaps the attitude of some members of this house , who seem only to want to blindly obey the instructions of the council .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1538"> the first point of agreement between the council and parliament concerns external actions , i.e. heading iv of the budget , for which our institutions shared a common goal , that is to say release substantial funding for the regions of the balkans in 2001 , taking into account recent developments in the situation policy in serbia , and this without requiring the other geographical priorities of the union &apos;s external action to make costs .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1539"> finally , agreement was reached on 23 november on an increase of payment appropriations of the budget for 2001 , limited to 3.5 % over the 2000 budget .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1540"> similarly , it is in respect of this interinstitutional agreement that the council has left substantial margins under the ceilings of the financial perspective established in 1999 , including topic 3 - internal policies - and for heading 4 - external actions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1541"> i hope that it can respond quickly .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1542"> the court of auditors recently confirmed in a special report that the one reached this goal , the means of the cohesion fund are properly used .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1543"> with regard to the specific cases that we have known for two years , that is to say kosovo and serbia , the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument allowed to fund exceptional expenditure by an exceptional effort .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1544"> while american companies receive three times more aid and a country , randomly , as turkey spends more than 10 % of the budget of the state agriculture and horticulture , this amounts to saying that europe wants to get everything free .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1545"> emphasis is placed on the output rather than input .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1546"> fish , commissioner , is a fundamental element of any healthy , balanced diet and protein-rich .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1547"> we believe that it is absolutely essential that the considered that this progress report is intended to restore the confidence of our citizens in the functioning of the institutions of the european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1548"> after a long period of conflict and war , during which our party has acted in a very resolute manner , it is important that the inhabitants of the balkans know this : when it comes to reconstruction , they can also count on us .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1549"> you undermine the interinstitutional agreement . let me tell you that , next year , we will examine in detail if we can still accept it .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1550"> with the ongoing commitment of the flexibility reserve , it is the transparency of the budget which suffers , and in the long run , this will lead to a loss of credibility .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1551"> i come before you , who represent the people of europe , for first expose you the results of the intergovernmental conference on the reform of the institutions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1552"> the number of areas in which the vote will be carried out by qualified majority was , i know , considered by the parliament as a priority for this negotiation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1553"> i also note that this igc resulted in an extension of powers and competences of the european parliament .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1554"> these last six months , it is also in the path of growth and employment that europe has progressed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1555"> two months ago , our education ministers adopted an action plan for mobility - a plan of 42 measures - and we have agreed to a substantial allocation of eur 400 million for the media plus programme , which is so important for european cinema and audiovisual and that - you know - the entire profession was waiting .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1556"> it is now up to the swedish presidency - which i remind that the environment is a priority - to lead the second package of proposals , including the creation of a european maritime safety agency .
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="1559"> in addition , in your own address at the beginning of the summit , you said that parliament would judge the success of nice not only in terms of quantity but also in terms of quality .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1560"> to meet this wish of citizens , we asked the double majority , only instrument that is objective , understandable and widely shared by the small and large member states .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1563"> madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , mr president of the commission , i would like to do a little background about a famous french physician , called coue and invented a method , coue method , based on the principle of autosuggestion and the autoconviction .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1567"> taking into account the interests and differences in the council would have avoided debates on the number of commissioners at which each state clings .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1568"> thank you , mr hager .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1569"> there is like a contradiction ...

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1572"> in practice , the summer period became the normal period .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1573"> but when i &apos;m back in italy , mr mr fatuzzo , the holiday-maker carlo fatuzzo , was told to have a new id card and a new permit , i had to redo the same statement to the police and the italian carabinieri .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1574"> madam president , i support wholeheartedly the report concerning the improvement of the protection of victims of crime , which demonstrates once again the commitment of the eu in the fight against crime and the protection of our citizens .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1575"> according to my sources , should be extradited to russia .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1576"> heartbreaking results for parliament : the refusal to see seriously expand the discussions to the majority ; the exclusion of parliament from codecision and , i say in passing , shocking composition fixation without that parliament is even consulted on this composition .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1577"> decisions on voting in the council and seats in parliament should be taken to the casino in cannes and not to the nice acropolis , with mr chirac in the role of chief croupier .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1578"> it seems that the swedish negotiators had more at heart to please the big countries to fight to preserve their own influence .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1579"> the treaty of nice contains a number of crucial steps towards an elitist european union as well as several measures to keep away the union of democracies and the citizens .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1580"> that is why , in the future , to advance this continent , we have a method that an intergovernmental conference is based on a convention , in which members of parliament , and not the chancelleries , have the last word .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1581"> that is our commitment , mr president prodi , commissioner barnier .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1582"> as the european parliament , the commission alone in defended the legitimacy , which i thank president prodi and commissioner barnier. they were unfortunately alone , which is felt in the final compromise .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1583"> &quot; better no agreement than a bad agreement &quot; , said the french presidency before the nice summit , and this morning , if i have understood correctly , we were told in substance &quot; better a bad agreement than not agree at all &quot; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1584"> but the historic failure of nice is that behind the decisions , it sees no vision for a union which will consist of 27 states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1585"> the contention of national governments to give europe a constitution finally sank. the hope that the heads of state and government themselves defenders of the idea of european unification has finally failed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1586"> old gaps have not been addressed and others have been added .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1587"> mr president , first i would like to join , too , praise that you have just made to mr brok and mr tsatsos .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1588"> i would like to simply regain some critics , or the lessons that i have heard here or there .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1589"> i honestly believe that the system - have i e not pretend it is clear and readable - is a balanced system .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1590"> that is what i will remember this debate , this presidency and this igc also .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1591"> with regard to the treaty of nice , there &apos;s little to say , because we do not yet have the conclusions of the european council and , therefore , we cannot add anything as long as we will not see them .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1592"> moreover , the treaty is a mixture of unsatisfactory elements and positive - satisfactory , but however preferable to the status quo , i guess , at least as regards the extension of the vote by qualified majority , the extension of the codecision procedure for the european parliament and the provisions on enhanced cooperation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1593"> there is the fact that the european parliament plays no role in the context of enhanced cooperation , while some leaders of national parties - including that of labour in his warsaw speech - promised that the it would proceed with any reform of the structural funds in real before 2013 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1594"> mr president , mr president of the commission , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is the winners and the losers of nice , but europe certainly does not belong to the winners camp , more than democracy and transparency .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1595"> things may not happen as well .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1596"> the outermost regions deserve better and parliament will continue , with the help , i am sure , commissioner barnier to work hard to give them all the place deserved them in the union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1597"> &quot; we have managed to keep things in hand &quot; or &quot; we have managed to block european decisions &quot; , tell in their own countries .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1598"> it is regrettable and the only sign of hope is that the european commission has clearly regained its confidence .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1599"> the debate is closed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1600"> mr president , i would like to first of all that the it was noted that this year &apos;s budget is due primarily to the work of all members of the commission , so obviously that to the work of its chairman , mr wynn , who has wisely handled the various situations that we have experienced , including situations of tension .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1601"> the member states , at the time , did not fear their public opinion and the enlargement to spain and portugal , was accompanied by a significant mobilization of resources .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1602"> the approval of a brs will therefore be essential , and therefore , the potential for savings is reduced again substantially , if not in its entirety .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1603"> there was no qualified majority in this parliament to return to article 272 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1604"> then , when i discovered that there is no debate on the revision for article 25 of the iia , i was quite disappointed , and the word is weak .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1605"> however , the european parliament can not continually revise downwards its commitments towards the outside .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1606"> we use 1.06 % of gnp of the member states , which gives us a margin more important that she never did so , and most important also that what had been expected in berlin , there is a little less than two years .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1607"> environmental policy , we can not lose us in the establishment of small measures , spaces limited , also useful that could be them , or even in permanent funding and a critique of institutions whose work does not particularly notable results , as is for example the case in my opinion , the european agency for the environment in copenhagen .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1608"> first of all , about the structure of the 2001 budget : it has been said that the agricultural budget was not increased enough .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1609"> i think it is a good thing and have managed to activate even the flexibility instrument to provide the necessary assistance to serbia , even though i quite agree with you to say that end up in the situation of a roaming flexibility instrument across europe across different countries and regions , and used whenever the need arises , cannot become a strategy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1610"> i expect that further debate takes place the month next topical debate and i propose to grant only limited to this debate in the resolutions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1611"> several areas can be listed in which the points of convergence can be found , as for example in the balkans , in the central region of the caucasus and asia .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1612"> this resource often passes through places of major conflicts .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1613"> this underlines the importance of the strategy , with russia and also the importance of your report mr oostlander .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1614"> the energy policy , which is linked to the policy of the great powers , is an important area of cooperation . you can cite as an example the problem of &apos; route to transport oil and gas from east to west .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1615"> a member of my party , a radical activist , journalist , was murdered a few weeks ago in tbilisi , city clearly under the mandate of the russian forces .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1616"> he offers a budget heading to part for the northern dimension , and defends an overall increase of aid to russia .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1617"> from this interest , the union has developed fields of action in many areas , as well in its common strategy for russia than in other documents .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1618"> in the explanatory statement , we read , in point dd : &quot; whereas , russia constituting a union with belarus policy , it is important for the democratic legitimacy of russia , that president putin and the russian government underline clearly and firmly the urgency of reforms and democratic progress in belarus , including report delivered in minsk on 16 october 2000 by the parliamentary troika of l &apos; european union &apos; , of the conseil de l &apos; europe and l &apos; organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1619"> l &apos; important northern dimension in this proposal gets an own budgetary appropriation , which is a really key point. as for myself , i propose that energy issues are becoming the locomotive of this important project .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1620"> other areas where we are trying to support the cooperative efforts of the european union on russia are the rule of law and the consolidation of democracy , civil society , twinnings , regional and cross-border cooperation and , above all , initiative nida , as several members have mentioned .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1621"> a quick word on kaliningrad. the partnership and cooperation agreement already provides an institutional framework for our dialogue with russia on trade , visa and border issues .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1622"> by applying more favourable requirements for visas for the inhabitants of secessionist regions or in the by exempting fully , the it support the legitimacy of their regime .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1623"> the question was this : there were cases where that directive has not been followed and where gmos were prevalent in nature .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1624"> i am afraid that we went there in a substantive debate that we do not have time to deal here .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1625"> the council remains deeply concerned by the situation in chechnya : the violence continues , the humanitarian situation remains very worrying at the entrance of the winter .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1626"> could the french presidency we relay and contact mr nielson to invite him with some prodding to go very quickly in chechnya ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1627"> this one is not , because you can see that the chamber is far from full .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1628"> mr president , i believe that the question was fairly accurate .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1629"> you are right , the fight against fraud is never sufficiently developed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1630"> however , i feel that the proposal presented by the french presidency is totally unacceptable , and that it has only one goal : maintain asylum seekers in outside the eu , which , in practice , could lead to the increase in illegal immigration .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1631"> last month , when i asked a supplementary question during question time , this president-inoffice had simply avoided it telling me : &quot; i do then repeat my previous answer &quot; and he then re-read his answer .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1632"> i can assure all members that interviewed me that the council will take into account their comments .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1633"> the council , by all these decisions , intends to restore the confidence of consumers in the european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1634"> you know , we act at all times in the state of our knowledge and therefore i can not quite do mine this analysis .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1635"> these are initiatives that the commission has taken or intends to take in the direction of the algerian authorities .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1636"> regarding your second question , the council fully shares the point of view of the secretary-general of the united nations aimed at involvement , in this exercise , all of the institutions concerned as well as experts , organizations of research or academic institutions which have an interest in the question of children .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1637"> the presidency is very pleased with this outcome which marks an important step in the implementation of the turkish pre-accession strategy defined the year last in helsinki .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1638"> guarantees to which the author of this question refers include the right of all accused to defend himself or to have the assistance of counsel of his choice and , if it doesn &apos;t have the means to pay for counsel to be assisted free of charge by a lawyer when the interests of justice so require ; to free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court ; to be tried within a reasonable time , or released during the procedure .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1639"> thus , as stated by the council in its previous reply , the program of mutual recognition can only bring improvements in human rights .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1640"> the decision to launch an operation would in principle take the form of a joint action .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1641"> the question of the honourable member concerning the views expressed informally by the president of the commission .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1642"> mr president , c &apos; is with great satisfaction that i present today &apos; hui to the plenary of the european parliament report on l &apos; stabilisation agreement and d &apos; association of croatia with l &apos; european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1643"> the european union has also said at the summit in zagreb on 24 november .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1644"> i see no contraindication to develop individual relations between the european union , croatia and the countries of the balkans and at the same time develop regional cooperation , on the other hand .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1645"> this question must be subject to other conditions , namely , that access to asylum in croatia must meet international standards and be held in humane conditions .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1646"> unfortunately there was also serious overflows during the reconquest .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1647"> hopefully forward strides in these negotiations and be able to conclude them quickly .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1648"> i know that the croatian government insists that the countries participating in the process of stabilization and association are judged on an individual basis , according to their respective merits .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1649"> certainly , in many respects , the hardest remains to be done , but i have no doubt a moment in the ability of the inhabitants of this country to the challenge to walk the difficult path of reform , offering to them and path leading to europe .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1650"> the problem facing the government becomes very apparent in regions which , under the suharto regime , were used , as a land of migration to deal with the problem of overcrowding and operated as if it were in conquered territories .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1651"> the eu should do the same .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1652"> our are very concerned and expect the european commission reaction to these developments .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1653"> but the level of this cooperation must take into account the actual progress made by the countries in the settlement of regional problems and the methods employed , the respect of human rights and also the collaboration that the country attaches to a positive development in the process of independence of timor lorosae , including with regard to the settlement of the problems faced by the refugees from west timor judging and condemning the militias who are guilty of criminal acts and who have murdered recently three staff members of the united nations .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1654"> the revolution in the country and the manner in which it took place are still the basis for cautious optimism .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1655"> certainly , the military has less influence , but they still have too much .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1656"> mrs maij-weggen has drafted an excellent report , and i therefore conclude by saying that europe must do everything in its power to support the country on the path of democracy , but it &apos;s the indonesians themselves to get rid of the legacy of the suharto regime .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1657"> she mentions in effect namely , unequivocally , the forces opposed to the essentials and demanding process of reform .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1658"> any outside intervention other than support for democratisation and the rule of law cannot be regarded as counterproductive and inflammatory to all parties .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1659"> it goes without saying that , since then , clocks themselves are not stopped in indonesia .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1660"> just two years ago indonesia was still governed by an authoritarian leader supported by the army .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1661"> the debate is closed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1662"> it is since in part outdated and the nice summit has nothing changed in the situation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1663"> however , views on the manner in which this protection can be ensured .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1664"> mr president , i can be brief because this is not the first discussion we have on this topic .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1665"> we do not believe that an increase of the solutions at community level can improve the fight against crime to the extent that our efforts will be imbued with so much indifference , neglect and secrecy as the general administration of the eu .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1666"> in my opinion , the european public prosecutor is only a first step on the road that leads to the corpus juris , a body of customary law for the whole of the continent .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1667"> we are losing large sums of money simply because they are not perceived by the member states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1668"> you know , the commission would have preferred that olaf is established as a fully independent authority .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1669"> we must not forget that this is the reluctance of parliament to give the green light to how the taxpayers &apos; money had been spent in 1996 that precipitated the fall of the commission in 1999 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1670"> we rely on the court of auditors which provides us with the weapons with which pull the shadow areas .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1671"> we strive to properly monitor the commission and the member states , and this report is an effort in this direction .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1672"> mr president , may i begin by welcoming the opportunity of this initiative and the diligence with which our rapporteur mrs eluned morgan has carried it out .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1673"> we must be able to judge if the situation improves or worsens .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1674"> indeed , the commission always retains information and did not respond to certain questions , particularly as regards the fléchard case .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1675"> i am sure that the assembly wishes him all his wishes of success in this business , even if i am a little afraid that &quot; discharge &quot; and &quot; procedure &quot; are among the first words that will deliver the baby .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1676"> i will also respond to mrs stauner , who has raised some questions that this agreement provides that requests for confidential information must be raised or sent to the commission by the president of the parliamentary commission .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1677"> once again , congratulations for your report !
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1678"> include in a directive that shareholders should receive a fair price has about as much effect as to say that an apple , when it is ripe , falls from the tree .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1679"> so i can only invite the assembly to approve the amendments of compromise tabled by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1680"> to be effective , useful and in the public interest , such a directive must : first , to avoid the direct involvement of the courts in preferring a regulator with wide discretionary powers under the authority of the act ; secondly , have rules on jurisdiction and clarify them , so you can use them ; thirdly , clarify what is meant by fair price and thresholds appropriate ; fourth , ensure that the direction can mistakenly prevent the shareholders to make decisions that they believe need to take regarding the future of the company in which they hold a stake .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1681"> it is true that the regulation of the european parliament does not offer this possibility , by transforming these debates in a pure and simple dialogue of the deaf .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1682"> third finally , clarity : the lack of clarity is particularly evident in the debate on the court , field in which i have little experience .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1683"> the european institutions have cure of the job losses and of business closures caused by the almost all of takeovers or mergers .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1684"> in addition , if we open the door to defensive measures , we will make maybe more difficult restructuring of the european markets , and in particular the protection of small shareholders .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1685"> community law or national law of several member states does not currently have binding rules on acquisition of enterprises .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1686"> mr president , i would like to thank parliament for the attention he devoted to this proposal as well as the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , particularly the rapporteur - mr lehne- , for the work they have done .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1687"> the first is in fact only the holders of securities and the second concerns only the supervisory authority .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1688"> the third part is not acceptable for the same reasons as those valid for all amendments so-called &quot; social &quot; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1689"> this situation is unacceptable to the european market because it is inconsistent with the requirements of the internal market .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1690"> there is a misunderstanding at the base because they think that the use of collective management societies will be compulsory , as is currently the case in austria .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1691"> the socialist group therefore wished that parliament discredit not accepting proposals which ridicule the votes that took place at first reading .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1692"> the opinion on the resale right are no borders at the level of the groups political but at the level of the member states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1693"> it is the artist against the right away .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1694"> whatever it is , name of what principle should we impose a tax on the resale of a table and do not do the same , for the benefit of the manufacturer or the tailor , for a car or a costume sold second hand ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1695"> for these same reasons , amendment no 4 and the part of amendment no 7 linked to this question must also be rejected .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1696"> discuss a crucial subject while we do not have yet in our own mother tongue of the amendments tabled at the last minute and amendments discussed in committee seems quite impossible .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1697"> it must therefore be an exception if we are having a debate without amendments .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1698"> we have agreement within the commission to keep the issue of such special services as endorsed by directive 67 / 1997 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1699"> madam president , i might still add things well , but i confine myself to saying that there has rarely been such a consensus policy among the various committees of this parliament called to pronounce on a problem .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1700"> this is our responsibility .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1701"> however , my group argues that we must naturally ensure at the same time , as a community , and as states members , to define a framework for a universal service .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1702"> and however , we are supposed to adhere to the commission &apos;s proposals without even being able to consult these studies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1703"> we are often here proud to represent european citizens .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1704"> we encase the step to the postal monopolies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1705"> to go further , referring to the 1997 directive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1706"> let me be clear on one point in particular .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1707"> while electronic communication , such as e-mail , takes off , the former state monopolies remain mainly inwards .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1708"> there is a link between all these findings .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1709"> i support the limit to 150 grams for reasons of prudence .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1710"> i &apos;m not a priori opponent of market and liberalisation , but the request that was made , namely analysis in good and due form , qualified , non-rushed and in consideration of all the implications , was not met , and now this compromise is why to me acceptable .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1711"> we fortunately have a directive which requires transparency on the part of public companies and i can assure you that gross subsidies will be examined under the microscope .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1712"> i have the impression that you have nothing , and it does not appear that you have listened to the arguments which have been presented to you .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1713"> the users will be losers , with employees , and european competitiveness and growth will decline .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1714"> the proposed liberalisation will not go without causing a significant impact on the services provided in the countryside , workers in the sector and daily mail users .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1715"> it is regrettable that the commission has preferred to rush headlong , in taking an ideological proposal that does not take into account opinions of the population .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1716"> this sector is suffering from fierce competition from these new technologies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1717"> invoke the realism as the plural left to seek a compromise with a part of the right solution is a way to disguise his own capitulation before private interests .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1718"> this figure is sufficient to support the public service tasks , such as adequate provision of a universal service and uniformity of rates .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1719"> i have nothing to learn about rural labour .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1720"> mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur , mr ferber , who has not had it easy , that is the least that the say .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1721"> it is a decision that you will regret .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1722"> mr president , taking into account the discussions that preceded , the commission realises the importance of this subject in the eyes of the parliament ; i also examined with great attention the many amendments to the draft directive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1723"> in short , this may prove insufficient and arrive too late , and to stop if necessary change dynamics , a seriously prejudicial to the adjustments underway and dangerous fact for long-term employment .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1724"> firstly , the head of british posts , mr. john roberts , who stressed that competition resulted in improvements to the level of quality and efficiency as well as a decrease in prices .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1725"> the monopoly of postal services may sclerosis these and cause loss of volume which , in turn , lead to job losses .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1726"> we must feed the dynamic of ongoing change , specifically launch the first stage of the process and set a timetable of upcoming reforms .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1727"> i note that postal services help us to warm up the atmosphere of the chamber , and i am delighted .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1728"> the report proposed , inter alia , the refusal of automatic switching to the only tariff , a tariff preference for the acp to 300 euros minimum , an assessment and a possible revision of the pane internal cmo .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1729"> for the rest , our position remains therefore the same : period of application of the system for at least ten years in order to ensure legal certainty of producers and operators , review at the end of those 10 years , no automatic passage to the tariff only , tariff preference of eur 300 for the acp . we have asked guarantees , in case management of a tariff quota system &quot; first come , first served &quot; would be implemented by the commission , because it will have serious implications for acp producers , unable today &apos; hui to take their place in the boat race which will soon open .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1730"> mr schwaiger said , during the previous debate , that you need to gather information supplementing more different points of view on the problem .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1731"> the implementation of the compromise taken , which fits with the wto standards , must be analyzed by the european commission in a report that the parliament will have to study within a reasonable time ; on the basis of the conclusions of this report and its analysis , it will propose the measures required , as the rapporteur points out in his work .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1732"> mr president , for perplexed observers like me , we move from the bizarre to the surrealism in this case .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1733"> powerful forces are opposed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1734"> but i think we can predict negative effects on smaller commercial operators and producers in the acp countries .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1735"> mr president , in the first place emphasis the effort of the european parliament , which tries to reach a balanced solution in the complex web of interests surrounding the com in bananas .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1736"> the conflict with the wto has led to reprisals in the form of trade sanctions and it is not easy to explain this to the exporters in the member states affected in a totally arbitrary manner in areas that have nothing to do .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1737"> the important thing is to save time in this final straight and i propose to vote in favour of the report by mr dary .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1738"> mr president , once again , our assembly will take a decision on the banana issue and i congratulate michel dary for the remarkable work he has done .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1739"> we want to strengthen our cooperation with the republic of korea and we have today &apos; hui an excellent opportunity to discuss the recent events on the korean peninsula .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1740"> ( parliament approved the commission proposal )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1741"> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to confirm the commission &apos;s position with regard to the amendments adopted yesterday by mr bolkestein .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1742"> ( the president declared the amended common position approved )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1743"> he then became &quot; homes of croatian citizens of serb origin &quot; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1744"> ( parliament accepted the oral amendment )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1745"> i would like to support the important decision of the ep vote the introduction of graphic warnings on cigarette packages . it &apos;s a huge step forward for public health because we will now have labels and images on cigarette packages that reflect what it actually costs of smoking .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1746"> the court of justice of the european communities also gave me reason .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1747"> this measure would not lead to smoke less harmful cigarettes , but summarize to export jobs .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1748"> they deceive people for far too long .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1749"> it &apos;s important programmes aimed at the improvement of public health , the fight against cancer , aids prevention , the fight against drug addiction , sanitary control and pollution-related diseases .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1750"> i do not see why can not also to entrust the management of its own social security to the public .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1751"> so , i believe that we must concern ourselves too - quickly , hopefully - artists retreat .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1752"> i therefore believe that this directive will have the effect of shifting the international market of art outside the european borders .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1753"> . beyond the effects of announcement of good intentions on the stability , the rule of law , the fight against corruption , the oostlander report is really just a vote of confidence in mr putin .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1754"> maij-weggen report ( a5-0323 / 2000 )
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1755"> and , if the is added to the corruption of european civil servants corruption of officials of national agencies , fraud increase . &quot; &quot;
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1756"> the establishment of this new authority must not lead to a leak of sovereignty in the main area .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1757"> i would like to apologise to parliament .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1758"> i have received many letters which testify that it is an issue that inflames the minds .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1759"> all must be in balance .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1760"> but the commission can certainly provide these information annually to parliament on the basis of the information available to it .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1761"> as regards amendments nos 19 and 32 , on organic bananas , i would again point out that there are already horizontal measures to guarantee the equivalence of the bio of third-country bananas and those produced in the community .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1762"> more relations will be good , more secure world and our population .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1763"> there are differences in our approaches to these issues , but i hope that this summit will send a positive message about the need to continue our efforts together , particularly in addressing sensitive issues such as access to affordable medicines with a tiered pricing .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1764"> kosovo belfast , millions of european citizens have to be grateful and i know that this parliament will join me to pay tribute today &apos; hui .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1765"> i think you mentioned there an important point .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1766"> lesotho has wondered : &quot; that has brought to lesotho liberalization undertaken by the wto ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1767"> i believe that the dialogue that exists between the union european and united states should be taken advantage to finally achieve this goal .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1768"> i was interested by what said ms. lucas about global trade and the importance of trying to ensure that more free trade serves both the interests of the poor than affluent people .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1769"> the subject is closed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1770"> i insist on this point , because some amendments want to establish a vat zero for services which , in my opinion , are of no essential or social nature .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1771"> this solution solves the problem of discrimination according to me , and meets the objective of simplification .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1772"> mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , the commission and the parliament made efforts these past years in order to harmonize the recovery of vat in the european union .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1773"> the committee on industry has adopted several proposals by thirty-nine votes to three .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1774"> there are underlying assumptions in this proposal on the place of taxation that might cause problems in the future in an international context .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1775"> so many good reasons to observe carefully if air transport supports its external costs and is not unfair competition to buses and trains .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1776"> when this happens between the member states of the european union , vat is perceived .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1777"> it is very unfortunate that there is still to this day no directive framework on the taxation of energy production .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1778"> the liberals thus share the ambitions of the commission , but we have very difficult to understand the concrete proposals it has presented .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1779"> i believe it is important to have criteria in case !
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1780"> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal of the european commission which aims to subject to vat the purchase of digital products downloaded directly from the network by resident consumers in the union from businesses in third countries , is a serious blow to the development of trade online .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1781"> so , with regard to the commission proposal to extend the timetable for reform , i can &apos;t express that my neutrality .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1782"> i am opposed to the desire for harmonisation of vat by mrs torres marques , but this i would like to especially mention the report by mr garcía-margallo on electronic commerce .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1783"> all states redistribute at least 30 , often 40 and sometimes more than 50 % of their national wealth created in the year .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1784"> necessary minimum rates , a maximum rate , but should be left to the states a margin allowing them to own microeconomic policies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1785"> personally , i have proposed an amendment on the harmonization of vat rates to correct the effects of competition unfair because , in the rate of vat , the operators from third countries have , at the time of registration , a very large selection of recording , given the significant differences - between 15 and 25 % - while community operators have not this choice .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1786"> if in addition we unilaterally taxa of aviation in europe fuel , european companies would be really struggling to remain competitive against european companies .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1787"> this is not like this that we need to organise society , and it is why i believe that it is a good proposal .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1788"> not only air fares would increase dramatically - probably £ 80 per ticket , thereby threatening the existence of the smaller carriers - but these damages would affect more aerospace industry , tourism , trade and , of course , cargo carriers - they carry today &apos; today a third of the world by air freight .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1789"> i think , like mr skinner , that the proposals of the rapporteur , mr garcía-margallo y marfil , vat applied to electronic commerce , are good .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1790"> i would like to speak only on the taxation of aviation fuel .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1791"> impose a vat to providers of third countries , mainly americans , is not only little practice but , in the case of newspapers and books , creates inconsistencies between a product sold online and this same product sold in the store .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1792"> third point : the eu should not establish a too hasty right and should do everything in its power to strengthen the european e-commerce and non insécuriser it .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1793"> the results of this consultation were discussed within the council ecofin at the end of the month of november .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1794"> a series of details must still be set .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1795"> it is in this context that this proposal tries to maintain existing harmonisation in the field of vat rates by confirming the minimum level of 15 % for the standard rate .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1796"> let me however recalled that the current community tax legislation does not allow that taxing national and intra-community flights .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1797"> a year after the sinking of the erika , we all ask ourselves if we have been able , or not , to meet the expectations of the citizens .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1798"> in the event that imo should not adopt the necessary measures , the commission would present to parliament and to the council a proposal on a community regime of liability and compensation for pollution hydrocarbons .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1799"> the parliament has taken its decision on 30 november ; they had a good model , and we decided quickly .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1800"> with regard to the issue of liability , i would simply say that the current fund is not sufficient to compensate all the damage caused by the erika oil spill .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1801"> mr ortuondo , in regards to your comments about article 6 , on liability for minor pollution , i &apos;ll first see what the council says , but the parliament already has a position on the subject .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1802"> the overall objective of this legislation was to eliminate distortions of competition through the establishment of a fair mechanism reflecting the costs of the infrastructure motor carriers and to harmonise levy systems in the internal market of the eu .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1803"> i thought that both would be addressed at the same time , but this is apparently not the procedure of this house .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1804"> the policy to adopt with regard to imports from third countries shall be determined on the basis of this assessment .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1805"> the role of the european union is not to fund the encouraging hatred and war .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1806"> i asked you about the participation of the commission in educational programmes , and you replied by side , commissioner .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1807"> will it consider the possibilities to expand this segment of the community budget ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1808"> let me say about texaco that the centre for social and economic rights hold it responsible for a high number of abortions and a rate of abnormally high cancer in ecuador .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1809"> how does intend , from january 2001 , the survival of what remains of this sector facing unfair competition from korea , again demonstrated in this latest report ?
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1810"> commissioner , i feel , above all relieved , in a way , to see that the commission is worried and , perhaps even , occupied the problem .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1811"> we believe that this could not be the case by extending assistance to operation all-out . instead , the commission must be prepared to advance a specific and targeted instrument to the case where the actions undertaken on its behalf by commissioner lamy would not results for the sector of the european union give .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1812"> the increase in prices resulting from anti-dumping measures should provide for a recovery of the profitability of the coke industry .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1813"> this proposal , which follows on from the multiple commitments made by the community in favour of ldcs , aims at promoting the integration in the world economy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1814"> i am sure that all my colleagues in are grateful .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1815"> this makes the connection with the question of mrs kinnock .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1816"> for this purpose , perhaps you could start by reassuring me telling me when the impact study will be available so that we can cite it to shatter some of the apocalyptic allegations that have surrounded your proposal and then give us some additional details concerning the safeguard clause i think you intend to introduce in this measure and the transition period that will precede its definitive entry into force .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1817"> these instruments are also available organisations like ecpat and the partners with whom they cooperate in the countries concerned .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1818"> we had a particular project for this .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1819"> reason for which the european patent office is installed in this city .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1820"> this is a perfectly understandable point of view , and that i share .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1821"> the commission will take therefore any measures it deems necessary .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1822"> the commission shall communicate to the honourable member that a complaint is pending concerning the thessaloniki metro project .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1823"> in this regard , i would also point out that from the time the concession agreement will be known in greece , the complainant will have eight months to make his own opinion and filed its complaint with the commission .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1824"> the legal definition of a strike is a competence of the member state .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1825"> i would like to thank the commissioner that s &apos; is striving to provide a response , but i would like to point out that , for the moment , in greece , students are facing l &apos; state of confusion following : d &apos; one hand , centres d &apos; free studies support that , on the basis of directive 89 / 48 / cee , they are empowered to issue diplomas d &apos; studies likely to &apos; be recognized provided that these studies are completed in britain , and l &apos; , the greek authorities and relevant agencies refuse to acknowledge these diplomas awarded to l &apos; completion of studies in britain .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1826"> proclaim l &apos; island of raippaluoto off the coast of vaasa independent kingdom , which would allow shipowners in question continue to enjoy duty-free sales .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1827"> however , i am sure to be able to say , on behalf of my colleague michel barnier , that the facts mentioned by the honourable member will be duly taken into account in the analysis of this proposal .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1828"> let me say briefly what is important element of my report and the point that i believe that it constitutes a key priority for this parliament , namely the question of linguistic diversity .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1829"> it is essential that we convince the commercial suppliers of potential investment gains and opportunities in societies that take into account linguistic diversity and exploitation of public sector information .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1830"> this means that digital content is a chance for all those who did not have access to school , either throughout their lives , either because they are disabled , and i hope that this digital content will enable a better approach .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1831"> it should also locate the production of content , which implies the adaptation of products depending on the linguistic and cultural needs and preferences of consumers .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1832"> mr president , i would like to congratulate mrs gill on her report .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1833"> content providers , the creative sector , people who are ultimately responsible for the production of these contents and which is also the e-content programme should therefore be involved in this consultation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1834"> before i finish , mr president , let me raise one last important point , one last question addressed to the commission .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1835"> i would like to thank parliament for its strong support for the programme budget .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1836"> the debate is closed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1837"> has the floor to the rapporteur , mr de roo .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1838"> a structural excess of noise is harmful to health people and diminishes their quality of life .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1839"> the committee of l &apos; environment here offers practical standards for the years 2006 , 2012 and 2020 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1840"> why becoming a popular party like ours , the epp , do not let aviation escape european legislation and also to no longer distinguish between military and civilian air traffic .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1841"> my group does not support the point of view of the rapporteur to want to fix right now through this directive maximum levels of ambient noise for airports .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1842"> i therefore agree with the rapporteur &apos;s roo when he proposes not to lose more time and transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise in a binding framework directive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1843"> another group , there would be technical problems .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1844"> it is the member states which , on the basis of their customs , would determine the length of this period in a defined range .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1845"> i am very surprised to hear any one say need us daughter directives .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1846"> we therefore need the framework directive and a combined approach . this is why i consider that much of the commission &apos;s decisions on the environment , public health and consumer policy are fair and correct .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1847"> this is not what we want .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1848"> we will make a leap forward when we get comparable information on the noise around airports .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1849"> the debate is closed .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1850"> this study was ever made .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1851"> mr president , at this late hour and with a piece of carrot in the throat , i think not having much to say to my colleagues .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1852"> these people have knowledge , for many years , the way in which cellulose is used as a binder , essentially in the bread .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1853"> as i l &apos; have already explained at second reading , a crisis lies at the base of this amendment to directive .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1854"> i believe that our parliament greatly improves the common position of the council and i would recommend l &apos; approval of the joint text .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1855"> . ( en ) i would like to thank the european parliament for having supported the position of the european commission and for the remarkable efforts made to meet the concerns of the council .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1856"> we know that the commission is currently preparing a programme of sustainable development throughout the european union which should be ready in six months .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1857"> as a legislative body , we should never seek to exacerbate the opposition between city and countryside .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1858"> the credits will be primarily intended for networks of cities organised at european level for their activities in the field of development and the dissemination of good practices in sustainable urban development .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1859"> in addition , in practice , it is at local level that decisions that we in this parliament should be implemented .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1860"> i believe that this innovative approach may provide an example for others to follow .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1861"> the commission cannot accept amendments nos 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 26 , 31 , 38 and 39 .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1862"> indeed , even if media is in do echo for a short time , the precautionary principle is not made its appearance on the international legal scene .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1863"> mr president , mr commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the legal and internal market committee noted some points concerning the precautionary principle , points that the found in the excellent report by our colleague , mrs patrie .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1864"> the public wants more to the cost of hazardous technological innovations which it turns , a few or many years later , they involve unnecessary risks to public health or the environment .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1865"> i am a proponent of the precautionary principle. but i wish to raise one point d &apos; concern .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1866"> it should be keep certain themes in mind to ensure proper operation .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1867"> first , there is no minimum threshold below which the precautionary principle could not be retained ; therefore , even in the event of low risk , it can be made recourse to the precautionary principle .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1868"> in the amendments that j &apos; have tabled , i try d &apos; clarify these points and to remove unnecessary parts .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1871"> mr president , adapted to all sauces , according to the circumstances and the interests of the moment , the precautionary principle may be the best as the worst of things .

<p><seg id="1894"> secondly , the report deals too negatively the linguistic and cultural diversity .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1895"> it is quite clear that europe is able to meet the challenge of the markets , thanks to the advantages that it has economic and employment and , of course , thanks to its cultural richness and linguistic diversity - which are mentioned explicitly in the notion of linguistic minorities and regional languages - face monolingualism that characterises a large part of the &apos; network &apos; .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1896"> mr president , i asked my daughter elisabetta - which , as you know , is deputy regional party of pensioners in lombardy - to give me an opinion on this council in nice : what she thought , if she considered that i should vote for .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1897"> the latter is now ready for l &apos; accession of candidate states .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1898"> they are have perhaps managed , at least temporarily , but at the cost of serious disadvantages : greater supranationality , less democracy , increase in l &apos; germany in the decision-making process .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1899"> this evolution may seem legitimate in the eyes of some , since &apos; it tends to translate into institutions respective weights of countries in terms of population .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1900"> it could therefore result in more difficulties in the implementation of the laws which apply in the sectors of the environment , the protection of consumers and the workplace , and we strongly urge the countries to demonstrate a sense of responsibility and to improve the effectiveness of decision-making procedures within the council .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1901"> the negotiations were difficult , but the strength of the union was reflected in its determination to find solutions acceptable to all .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1902"> this situation is aggravated by the expansion of qualified majority decisions , under certain conditions , 14 countries that can make decisions on behalf of the 27 or 28 , as is eliminated in practice the right of veto on important policies for portugal , such as the structural funds or agreements on commercial policy .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1903"> we keep l &apos; unanimity in the council and therefore a latent failure to act .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1904"> for our part , as long as europe is what it is , the issues of constitutional importance or of fundamental interest for the states , such as those that have been discussed in nice , can be set otherwise. they must be unanimous .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1905"> this has the effect of increasing the power of the big countries at the expense of small .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1906"> these low prices are not only the result of decreases in personnel and d &apos; other economies but also of public policy .

<p><seg id="1908"> while structures of achievement are passed d &apos; a project an approach approach by program this program - that l &apos; one can already challenge , because &apos; part of the proximity of the citizens , and the added value the european visibility is already lost , in my opinion , and also because member n states &apos; were not all created regional authorities- the innovative actions in the context of the esf maintain a project approach .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1909"> the trick is to determine which , but we must also have the strength to admit that failure , we must not bail out them at the expense of the state and adopt a strategy that takes account of this aspect .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1912"> i agree especially that the instruments of territorial policy must be geared towards sustainability , strengthening economic and social cohesion , and , above all , the creation of qualified , economically viable and sustainable jobs .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1913"> first point : we , and the people on the spot , consider that innovative measures were a stepping stone very useful for authorities and local communities which are not actually part of the structural funds , but which should be included , to learn how to manage small-scale projects to be able to play a more effective role in the dominant programs in the years to come .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1914"> on their bar road and we lose this added value of the direct relationship between the european cupola and the closest public institutions of the problems of the citizens .
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1920"> another concern of the 6th framework programme of research and development : in its draft , the &quot; marine technology &quot; line , which existed in the fifth , seems , today &apos; hui , have disappeared .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1921"> mr president , l &apos; approach of the end of &apos; year , hold a debate on the situation in the shipbuilding sector seems to have become a tradition .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1922"> in recent weeks , the commission has told us that the subsidies plan , through which our industry survives , should be deleted as soon as january on behalf of a so-called improvement of its competitiveness .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1923"> so therefore , it is the state which pays much , if not all , profits from this company .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1924"> and this , because we cannot condemn a situation of unfair competition .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1925"> discussions in the oecd rose little , very little progress , and the possibility of concluding a binding agreement at the international level in the field of shipbuilding seems remote .
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="1934"> this is a technical problem that requires a technical answer. faster repair will be completed , the better it will be for everyone .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1935"> we all support the right to self-determination .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1936"> it is especially significant , and it is on this point i would like to stress , in that it shows what state is called united europe and in this regard , it is almost even fun for the separatists .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1937"> it is scandalous to see that at the moment 11 nuclear attack submarines on the 12 in service with the royal navy are immobilized. four are in repair and seven show signs of fatigue such as those which secure the hms tireless .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1938"> the specific case is more serious than this since it concerns , on community territory , hundreds of thousands of beings humans , not only spaniards , of course , but also of all nationalities , in particular british .
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1939"> i would note , to return to the contents of the motions for resolutions on the role of the commission , that the british government does not consider that the euratom treaty is applicable in military situations of this type .
</seg></p>
