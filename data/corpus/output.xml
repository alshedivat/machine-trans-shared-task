<p><seg id="795"> finally , as far as fisheries – who is a hobbyhorse of mine - then i am assuming that the three sides will make every effort to guarantee a positive development in the future .

<p><seg id="796"> we only have to suggest that we must re-examine the whole procedure , not only as regards the annual report of the court , but also to be published tomorrow in respect to the special reports , such as these .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="803"> i believe that , if we want to ensure that this charter is the foundation stone of a european constitution , it will have to be supplemented in the future . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="804"> in this respect , the evidence of a political decision and of a major new opportunities to show to the european citizens the full extent of this initiative . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="805"> the charter is , then , a text of its coherence . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="806"> i am sure that the members of the convention which will be able to confirm this . this will be reflected here at all 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="807"> i have , of course , your rapporteurs once again that the charter is to wish the prelude to a constitutional treaty and it is known that i , for my part , i would like to remind you , in favour of this . but because we have kept to a time when great precision in light of what is happening now , that the european council in biarritz , was only able to find that a majority of member states were not prepared to discuss , at least for the moment , the integration of this charter into the treaties . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="808"> on behalf of my group i would expressly like to thank all colleagues from my group not only but also , more particularly , ingo friedrich , vice-president of parliament , which has brought our business . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="809"> the european union today is much more than an economic community , 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="810"> that is our proposal . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="811"> it took several weeks as labelling is the right to strike . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="812"> secondly , it fills a gap in the protection of fundamental rights of people living in the union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="813"> we therefore believe that the charter is important , in my capacity as principal position , solely because it sends a debate and a debate that we think it would be appropriate for the future , but which also has to develop further , to be held in parallel with the unification process . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="814"> one may guess the reasons behind the vote on the charter to a programme aimed at establishing the first part of a constitution for what could be called the united states of europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="815"> but we want a europe which is flourishing , prosperous europe that would increase , which is why we did want to and have to speak on these principles of nationality . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="816"> this scope , i want to say something about this .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="819"> it is never too late . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="820"> the present charter seems to me on this can be an incorrect , which creates an unsure copy into play , for example on legal affairs when she says , in item 2 of article 2 nobody may be sentenced to capital punishment &apos; , so good – here - , and add &apos; or &apos; . executed 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="821"> i have one further comment to the chairman of the council : as a former member of the trade jurisdiction , then i can assure you that the overlapping of competences of jurisdictions different quickly come up with a different contribution case-law will be a cause and that hives can therefore anticipate that different approach . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="822"> the reference to article 6 is logical and i believe that the council presidency must take notice of what mr barón . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="823"> that is an important message to send to the present time , given the fragile political situation of one or other institutions in member state . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="824"> this charter of social rights is a step backwards in comparison with the legislation of many member states and , out of this game postponements , sets an instrument to amend or les undermine it ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="825"> mr president , the charter spells out the existing ones , while making a great success for the historic breakthrough . accomplish 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="826"> mr president , the proposal and the approval of the draft charter of fundamental rights should find a consensus rather broader . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="827"> moreover , the attack memo y union rights are ignored and considers that the text , basically , is intended to establish the free movement of capital . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="828"> thus , this charter offers additional protection to the citizens are most vulnerable in our european society , which is good . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="829"> first of all , they must include a reference to the charter into article 6 of the ec treaty . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="830"> for many years it was discussed the possibility of the european union to accede to the european convention on human rights , as is the case of its member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="831"> mr president , colleagues , the charter which we are about to vote with conviction , represents a step forward towards the building up of a europeanist certainly of a political europe in which we believe firmly . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="832"> it is important not to destroy the authority of both bodies . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="833"> my colleagues in the committee on civil liberties have informed me the honour of appointing me as rapporteur on the respect for human rights in the union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="834"> the charter has many enemies , but there are many who recommended it . we have listened to the critics of those who do not want a political europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="835"> in both as the text would be too binding , or even too late in respect of some of the reforms that we risk becoming demolishing ; for others it would be binding . empty or insufficiently 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="836"> i would remind you that the etuc , for example , which has been heard , which accounts for 60 million people in europe , many hundreds of ngos have been consulted , that citizens , quite simply to say that it was possible that some of their contribution , and must make swift progress their proposals were accepted by the convention .

<p><seg id="837"> the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="838"> this parliament must , within that forum and in its debates , has been made clear to our turkish partners to be feared that they do not serve any sort of interference in their internal affairs , a european will , but we are offering them an agreement entered into more precise , on the occasion of the definitional accession partnership , commissioner , and of course with the charter of fundamental rights . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="839"> if we wanted to ask of the conditions , should have been done last year on the occasion of the earlier decision . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="840"> i believe that this excellent report by mr morillon , bears witness to the desire to have the capacity to take this process of turkey , with a sense pre-accession of a major and legitimate to be alert to the reforms that romania still has considerable always prescribing .

<p><seg id="841"> mr president , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by thanking most warmly for their reports and seppänen morillon mm . at the political and very constructive and well-informed says this debate takes place at a time , at a time when we are very much in favour of giving a capable to relations between the european union and the decisive stage twist maybe turkey . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="842"> i confirm again that we have to be concerned about the inadequate respect for human rights and minority rights , that we have to be concerned about the role assigned to the army by the constitution , that we remain deeply concerned about the situation of the people of the state of emergency which is a kurd and origine maintained in the four countries . in the southeast of province

<p><seg id="1493"> consequently , my concern , at the present time , is not so much on the problems of health which are , of course , considerable and such important and would involve our acceptance of this restriction qu extremely restrictive interpretation of the legislative power from the european parliament . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1494"> mr president , if it is truly a law on the close of the second reading , it will lead to a restriction on freedom of the industry on the one hand and greater protection of public health .

<p><seg id="1495"> the results of research in this area are so clear that we cannot , as european legislators , do not keep up with these councils .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1507"> . ( de ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i note once again that the advantages and disadvantages of summertime are giving rise to discussions in greater depth .

<p><seg id="1508"> our group believes that the proposal which has just been made is a good one , so it takes the view in favour and that new amendments are not necessary . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1509"> another problem , there is , as in the autumn , during the world of agriculture , it specifically states that the institution that should have disappeared . humidity morning surprisingly , the natural world is not suited to the directive . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1510"> as regards the amendments which have been tabled , the commission has agreed with amendments nos 3 and 4 , whose aim is to make the system more transparent and to point out that the principle of precaution .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1515"> finally , and in this connection i should like to express my disappointment that this provision was not from this council compromise in the proposals for a withholding tax in my opinion , the conduct of the s office for the single biggest

<p><seg id="1517"> perhaps , i would add , do we have opened a new method of operation in the field of codecision .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1519"> this is an area which can be taken into account in the context of the new community programme for public health which is due to begin shortly .

<p><seg id="1522"> the european union cannot accept that they receive different treatment depending on the member states in which they have been victims of the offence or according to nationality .

<p><seg id="1530"> as i said before , the commission , following up its communication on 14 the july 1999 , is working on the adoption of specific measures to assist the victims , particularly through the support it on to the european forum of care services envisaged for the victims . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1531"> we take note of it . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1532"> i believe that the institutions , and in this case the commission , should work with more serious approach to this house in order for the proposals will in time and for the operation to appoint a rapporteur , will deal with the commission &apos;s proposal to table the amendments , in committee , and then we can reach debating debating in plenary . we are being requested to do this in plenary , which is not possible . one single

<p><seg id="1537"> another reason for dealing with this topic may be the attitude of some members on its knees of the house , who seem to know that the decisions of the council . obey blindly

<p><seg id="1539"> finally , an agreement was reached on 23 november on the appropriations for payments is a growing trend of the budget for 2001 , which is restricted to 3.5 % over the budget 2000 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1540"> similarly , it is in a manner consistent with this interinstitutional agreement that the council has left substantial margins under the ceilings of the financial perspective established in 1999 , in particular for categories 3 , internal policies – and on heading 4 - external actions .
