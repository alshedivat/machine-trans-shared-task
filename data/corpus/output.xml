</seg></p>
<p><seg id="190"> mr president , commissioner , some of the debate shows , in fact , that we have here is in need of a directive , because if we said that europe is involved in such a way as an area that should in centralizing the substance of the member states , and bearing in mind the addressing of what happened in recent months in numerous countries in europe - just yesterday on television , there was yet again by a host of reports on attacks against synagogues jewish sur rape foreign , and so on . let us just be cheek to dare to come and say that europe has no need for a directive to combat discrimination . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="191"> i still have two messages . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="192"> i therefore believe that it is necessary to involve the public and private sectors and , in this respect , i think that the public sector must take the lead .

<p><seg id="193"> article 13 of the treaty of amsterdam has been a challenge to the european union . we are committing the community of the specific powers to initiate a package of measures to combat discrimination , so that the same level of protection is guaranteed to all the disadvantaged groups .

<p><seg id="197"> i would also like to thank the committees involved for their support and collaboration with a view to achieving a judgment coordinated a short space of time . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="198"> there are three types of amendments . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="199"> the commission is willing to simplify the wording of article 5 in order that this provision should be better understood . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="200"> we all know that this is very important , but i must point out that in some member states , the collection of this kind of data is a violation of the provisions on the protection of privacy . constitutional

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="203"> it is clear that a good number of weapons are to be found in the wrong hands with the activity to arms brokers . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="204"> in this sense , the titley report is particularly successful . it also highlights not only its merits but also all the loopholes - the limits of the report presented to us , as well as the feasibility of the code of conduct . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="205"> we are still seeking a regulation , which is more restrictive and more urgent given the developments in the market and in the arms industry . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="206"> mr president , despite its merits undeniable , the report is still quite technical and is taking place in a field of safety and to a model based on the armed forces , which gives a weight disproportionate to the views of the arms industry . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="207"> on the basis of this account , i plead for a very clear : what criterion is so prevalent in the event of a contradiction between the criteria put forward by mr titley , victims of this disaster ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="208"> the code has already moved to the mutual understanding of the policies of member states , it has set up an efficient consultation mechanism and stimulated the dialogue about the implementation of its provisions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="209"> several of these projects are under way or under consideration . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="210"> in its resolution of 18 may 2000 , parliament has provided us with a strong support to this project . the implementation of this initiative is , by now , set in motion . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="211"> these proposals will be added to a series of communications specialize representative other contributions to the achievement of the european research area . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="212"> this is an important role that it has to play .

<p><seg id="213"> commissioner , i would like to draw your attention to a question for a very long time , all those who have been involved in research . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="214"> there are some new formulae for . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="215"> but in this regard , i would nevertheless like to say to parliament until it is important that this need , which has expressed and which is also the engine of economic development and innovation in this area , is taken into account at the level of the meda programmes and in all the programmes for external relations . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="216"> and if we cannot give you , as of today , to answer is that i wanted to specifically , in this item of orientation , call upon the member states to adopt positions , because there will be no european research area that we accept that at the will of the commission . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="217"> on the ecsc , as you know , there has been agreed , and research will continue . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="218"> i have to be accountable , not only to the court of auditors , the taxpayers , but first of all to the european parliament , who was instructed to monitor and approve this budget , and i think that this is my job , and my duty to say , at the point that i think this is an opportune moment , what is happening and to act transparently , with respect to the budgetary authority that constitutes the european parliament . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="219"> i believe that the decision is yours , your services are provided with the elements , but they must be able to respond .

<p><seg id="221"> .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="222"> so i repeat , the commission is unable to ensure that member states to change what the level of excise duty . 
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="229"> i want to thank the commissioner is going on . this should be pointed out . in short , but very clear about the matter .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="242"> mr president , as other speakers have already pointed to us today , i congratulate mr titley for his report . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="243"> mr president , the european defence industry is certainly important , but peace in the world it is referred to at least as much . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="244"> it is certainly very confusing to see the other european countries will become involved in the manufacture of armaments . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="245"> the arms trade is putting forward the singular character that it is the poor countries which are mainly the purchasers of the countries which , for just anything of any one side , cannot find money , but which to bring in order to buy weapons . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="246"> in his first report , the committee of experts independent stressed that the internal control and audit constituted activities completely separate , even in the conflict - which are not to the same department . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="247"> secondly , the european commission &apos;s proposal would have the effect of imposing on all the institutions , the obligation to nominate a auditor internally . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="248"> parliament has not yet received this official text of the proposal but we managed to see an provisional and i hope that the entire text is soon to be forwarded to parliament , i also understand the commission &apos;s wish to ensure that the text is both legally and linguistically irreproachable . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="249"> it is also important to retain the option to appeal to an ex ante control independent structurally decentralized without doubt , but which is certainly not under the director-general who are in charge of our directorate-general is the subject of control . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="250"> however , to date we do not know and as long as it will be the case , i would like to ask this house to accompany the process of reform of the european commission with a bit of scepticism . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="251"> i believe that the committee on budgetary control made a serious discussion on this subject and the commission is certainly a good idea if it is based , over and over again , on that in pursuing its purview reforms . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="252"> unlike the audit , the financial control classic verifies already up and the budget procedure and that maybe the contracts may be no more have been signed , and payments carried out . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="253"> there is a certain lack of interest , which i am sure that the commissioner will take due note so that we achieve the utmost urgency to the aim of this reform which the report marks the beginning . hulten 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="254"> i would like to thank the two committees - the committee on budgetary control and the committee on budgets , for this debate a very heated and the rapporteurs mr van hulten and mr dell &apos;alba , who was unable to attend today . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="255"> i think that is so much , my view , i am sorry for not providing myself imagined . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="256"> it goes without saying that we do not pretend through harmonizing legislation in matters of protection of minors , not only because , in accordance with the subsidiarity principle , each member state is sovereign on this matter , but also the prevailing view cultural and moral and hence the evaluations of these subjects , differ greatly from country to country . he only exists , for example , no single definition of the concept of a minor , violence , and so on . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="257"> i believe we need to educate the children to be able to benefit , in accordance with good practice for the latter , and force those parents to equip their children to look at what is worth it and to leave aside the rest . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="258"> he must nevertheless insist similarly to the fact that we should not rely on just introducing mechanisms filtering ensured it affords to programmes and provide furthermore broadcasters selected programmes from their responsibilities . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="259"> i must say , by way of conclusion , to the concern of the liberal group , compared with the growing supply of television programmes that involve in violence and sex . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="260"> if , therefore it is essential that all parties involved , beginning with the children and , through to their parents , teachers , the countries concerned , the european union , to conclude with distributors and producers of the programmes , can contribute ideas on this subject and should learn how to behave and react in the face of all these proposals and to the effects they can have on individuals . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="261"> this is not to generalise and no possibility of simplifying them , even though the time is running out in the european parliament , but the examples are multiple . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="262"> however , subsidiarity must be used to do something , rather than of smokescreen yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="263"> the aim of such a study is to assess the effectiveness of the approach proposed , an approach based on the principle of self-regulation , and my services have to launch this issue and sent a questionnaire to the member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="264"> nobody has more respect than i am to mrs reding and the staff to which she or comes within the commission , so i am sure that , when she responds tonight , it will be able to clarify the points that i have raised and that it rather than being just issue a statement . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="265"> that is why the question of the researchers must be kept to , mr evans . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="266"> it would be wrong , i believe , that the commission have now , in private . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="267"> i am very satisfied that the rapporteur has taken account of the possibilities of the citizens of the candidate countries to be affected by the recommendations in the area of mobility . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="268"> despite the positive opinion of the courts , the recommendations of the commissioners and the actions taken at council level , nothing has been done to resolve the situation of the assistants , whose status has been reduced by the italian minister for education .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="274"> economic recovery of europe is today an established fact . let us then use the current weakness of the euro , which promotes the superb competitiveness price , to hasten a rebond productivity that innovation can create both in terms of instruments and means of production and of organisation of markets .

<p><seg id="275"> and will this conquest is at this point we have gained that awareness of the expansion will weakening , two generations , from now on , do not recognise that this europe , composed of interdependence and open borders .

<p><seg id="276"> this sector that is emerging is opening up to women , a wider access to the labour market .

<p><seg id="277"> the second theme of this conference of ministers , refers to the reconciliation of family and professional life . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="278"> firstly , the employment guidelines , this time have now been equipped with quantified objectives , so it is therefore proposed to increase the employment rate among women to 60 % by 2010 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="279"> the expectations of society are strong , and this has not gone unnoticed by members of the convention that have been happier with a charter &quot; genderly correct &apos; . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="280"> the participation of women in the labour market makes a lot less than men , this difference is increasing in some countries , particularly in southern europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="281"> i happen to a man , but in the european union , the men and women do not have the same chance of success . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="282"> this takes place should possibly be emphasised in this chamber . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="283"> mainstreaming has been repeatedly mentioned here and i can only endorse what has been said , namely that where economic policy for example , it is vital to get down to thinking about the aspect between men and women yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="284"> women , by a selection of the very nature , is the recommendation does the future of humanity in its own territory . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="285"> i am therefore really embÃªtant nevertheless , these women who , from the depths of their business , or of the accounts of their act , are rejecting the bright future for the euro . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="286"> the report before us is based , however , on an interpretation of the principle of equality . fully-contrived 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="287"> the human being is a creature independent and responsible in its relations with , on the one hand of god , who represent its creator . and all the other hand , those like him .

<p><seg id="292"> women are forced to temporary work , debates and which are more strongly to insecure employment and unemployment , paid for an average of 30 % less than men . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="293"> that is why we must assess the true situation of women , we need to develop indicators , we must continue to give a binding force to our political action , so that the progress are of benefit to all and not just to some of them .

<p><seg id="294"> that is obvious . nor will the community that i am one - since i , too , like many of you , i have a pathway associative d thirty years - knows movements associative movements feminists movements intellectuals , obviously , have worked to make progress on this matter and that , today , we are on our place in our role of responsibility , an institutional role .

<p><seg id="295"> i have not given up hope , even so , to improve this text .

<p><seg id="394"> commissioner , thank you for your very interesting speech .

<p><seg id="395"> the commission has defined , by now , five categories of action that we can regard as having a strategic importance . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="396"> we insist , at the same time , on the need for measures and these connections and they complement each other for these areas of economic life , participation , of the representation on equal terms , social rights , civil society , of the roles and stereotypes of the two sexes .

<p><seg id="397"> this presupposes that we are committed in one way in a policy for women , which goes from the institutions and politics , and we must also move towards a better adaptability strategies expected in the field of equal opportunities .

<p><seg id="403"> mr president , i welcome the report presented by the commission . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="404"> i understand , in the light of recent events , that the commission decided to adopt a tougher line , and quite rightly so - in respect of south korea . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="405"> this is important because of the need for transparency . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="406"> when a decision taken by competition policy , we must take account of its effects on social policy , structural and industrial policy ; if we do not do this , its policy on competition within the ideology unspoiled . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="407"> as you know the commission opposed this merger and this triggered a wide-ranging debate on how the rules of competition and are proving effective calculate and assess the sectors of the market . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="408"> mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , thank you for the reports presented cordial today ; they do not simply state of the past , and they allocate the themes of the current debate and include already commission projects . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="409"> finally , the strengthening of individual responsibility of individual citizens could only create legal uncertainty , but a european competition policy needs to look at the behaviour and the culture outside the institutions .

<p><seg id="415"> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am presenting today to the house , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , a proposal for a resolution on the commission report on the sole mechanism of financial support in the medium term in the balance of payments from the member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="416"> with the current level of integration on economic , financial and monetary affairs , the probability that one or two member states are connected for balances of payments is extremely reduced from an institutional point of view , but frankly the mechanism needs to remain in force . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="417"> the directive we are discussing today the greatest guarantee is maintained and guaranteed varieties grape traditional that characterise the planting of vines in the regions .

<p><seg id="418"> she will tell us which is as if it intends to continue to prepare for the entry of gmos in our own plates . and now within our glasses , and that , unfortunately , with the complicity of the french presidency and in full of touch with european consumers . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="419"> i think it would be appropriate to approve the klaÃŸ report and i particularly welcome the additional guarantees given by the amendments , such as that of the committee on agriculture also regarding the reference to directive no 220 / 90 , to be amended with regard to the aspect to gmos . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="420"> there are , mrs klaÃŸ , a second subject troublesome yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="421"> by accepting this amendment , we will create hindrances artificial to trade . this would be contrary to the main objective of the proposed directive , namely the promotion of the internal market . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="422"> i therefore consider that article 7 ( 4 ) has not been respected . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="423"> this was you mistake legal matter , madam president . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="424"> in the social sphere , i believe we should be able to also move forward , provided , however , it does not touch on the principles that are the foundations for the individual national social security systems . this will give some room for manoeuvre . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="425"> until then , the preparatory group is , which met yesterday to work on a qualified majority and on closer cooperation must be , showing a very real . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="426"> i heard the president-in-office of the council , mr moscovici , referred to it that it calls &apos; the spirit in biarritz . &quot; 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="427"> one needs to reassure them , say to those who are concerned about the fact that under no circumstances unsettle fiscal sovereignty of states , say to those who are worried that if it is not a question of mergers , specifically by the lowest common denominator , the social protection systems , but simply to make it function in an enlarged europe , the common market and the single market . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="428"> we believe this is an essential criterion for calculation of the outcome of the intergovernmental conference to be defined as a success , namely that the taking of decisions by majority voting should become the decision-making and a base for the future in the council of ministers and that the european parliament is being discussed at the same for the things which are legislation in these various issues . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="429"> but there is a fundamental issue , i would like to ask the president-in-office to clarify . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="430"> in this regard , i would also like to ask that we took a clear stance on the proposal we are doing and which , in our opinion , has a political meaning . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="431"> this means that the decision by qualified majority voting the rule in the council , along with codecision by parliament must become common practice in agriculture , for example . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="432"> i too would like to wish the success of nice and i am pleased that the people of europe and that a large number of associations , ngos or trade unions , a lot of effort into the prospect of nice . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="433"> it is already known that this model in the context of cooperation in matters of policy to justice . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="434"> in this regard , i do not share the feelings of the president of the ppe group on the question : &apos; a single commissioner &apos;un member state &quot; . dimitrakopoulos and 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="435"> i would also like to pick up on the number of members of the european parliament . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="436"> how , therefore , can we imagine that there are clear on your doing so to speak , a situation develop ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="437"> that is why i believe that with the resolution we are going to vote tomorrow , we impose a very clear mandate to our two representatives , elmar brok and mr tsatsos , enabling them to submit a proposal along these lines on the table of nice . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="438"> . ( fr ) we friserions correctly , it seems ridiculous . i hope that substantial progress between now nice will be able to be made on this point . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="439"> unfortunately , france has more to express its own interests and those of the large states of the proposals that are likely to overcome the differences of opinion , although mr moscovici is now trying to convince us of the opposite . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="440"> i must tell you that article 93 , as formulated by the presidency , does not allow us to respond to this important debate , which is simple . 
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="587"> that is why the over 80-year actions put forward in the white paper , are absolutely necessary . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="588"> food safety is a concern of the world . we cannot isolate ourselves faced with the products of the united states or in the developing countries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="589"> it must be independent of the member states , the european institutions , and of the food industry . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="590"> the human body must carry the name of &apos; authority &apos; is because , in english , and in most of the other languages , that word is giving the idea of a body which , in the process of risk assessment has the powers and ability to use one another , from time to time the judgement , and who therefore is not a simple representative of what the others want it to do . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="591"> in this context , i would argue in favour of food products , cheap , those that are bought by those families , and whom eat children and young people . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="592"> the second point is that the bowis report makes it clear that the european food agency is responsible for risk analysis .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="601"> however , the institution of a european food safety authority is contributing to a certain extent , at a high level of health protection . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="602"> i have tabled an amendment which , in my view , is not insignificant , unlike in the words of mr whitehead , who says that it is unnecessary . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="603"> in my opinion , that alone is going to restore consumer confidence in an area of policy it is important for producers and consumers . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="604"> from now on , the policy will be dealt with more coordinated and integrated , and she will encompass the whole food chain . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="605"> this is why the food authority is needed , and this is why we give it , and rightly so , due attention . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="606"> that is why i am in favour of amendments nos 14 and 19 , the aim of which is making a number of principles which must be taken over the choice of location to be fighting a venue . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="607"> this seems an attitude which makes sense . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="608"> i would like to emphasise certain points in particular . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="609"> mr president , the european food chain is one of the safest in the world . however , the bad practices , and the recent scandals have imposed an agenda to which our commissioner , mr byrne , has replied admirably yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="610"> we already have a huge number of organisations and institutions and associations and of initiatives , for which responsibility is to ensure food safety . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="611"> individual responsibility of the consumers will always be , in spite of the safety of products . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="612"> probably not , as is rightly underlined in mr blokland . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="613"> the existence side by side - and i have particularly highlighted this - on the food safety authority and the current system of the advisory committees has no raison d &apos;Ãªtre . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="614"> i would urge the commissioner , at a time when we will move on to the series of legislative documents , to avoid possible damage excesses legislative line and the red tape , especially as regards small and medium-sized enterprises . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="615"> i hope that the new proposal will grant all the same attention to these points . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="616"> indeed , the food authority is designed as a centre of scientific excellence in the service of the community in the board : consumers , institutions and member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="617"> this is only right and i concur with what parliament wanted to resort in articles 95 et152 the treaty . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="618"> obviously we still have much to do . for that reason that we must welcome the commission proposal . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="619"> in this respect , we must attach great attention to the problem and to conduct a campaign that raises awareness so that they are not forgotten . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="620"> the commission can and must also play a vital role in this area . it will have to tell us what it proposes to do about it too . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="621"> by means of our question , we would like to encourage the commission to persevere down this route and to strengthen this initiative . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="622"> i would also like to highlight the key role played by civil society , for the non-governmental organizations very motivated and , more especially , by the players in the international campaign to ban anti-personnel mines . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="623"> we need to recognise the particular nature of certain countries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="624"> turning specifically to the report that mrs bonino , i should like briefly to inform you of the comments made by the commission on the very few amendments tabled by parliament that it is very difficult to adopt in their present form . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="625"> in addition to the search for a strengthening of capacities and property to local level , we need to be able to make the most of and the vehicles which exist , in the place where they are . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="626"> we should focus on the actual guilty party , namely the illegal armed groups and governments who are not open to the irresponsible civilian population and use landmines profligate to cause terror . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="627"> the effectiveness of the use of resources is dependent to a commitment by the high level , a focus for proper and management is a responsibility . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="628"> i believe that both you and parliament are in agreement on this point . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="629"> finally , let me thank mrs bonino . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="630"> this is something that we must ensure , for , to come to the balkans , the west and the european union , in my opinion , have their responsibilities , if , by dint of their speeches of political , half of the region is a real minefield . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="631"> one point on which representatives of ngos i have received of the criticism in the course of a discussion is the confusion of military activities and the specific ngo at points 11 and 15 of the resolution . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="632"> it is absolutely necessary to ban the manufacture of mines in the european union and also export outside the european union .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="739"> i do , from the gallery , and with the weight of the democratic representation of europe that we have , an appeal for sanity and wisdom of the two parties , which take on the 30th , brussels , a meeting at the highest level , the european commissioner for fisheries and the moroccan minister , if , as i hope , its presence in brussels is confirmed , and also the foretold delegations technical , with the secretary of state for foreign affairs of morocco , if it has also is confirmed , with the director-general of fisheries in the union with its head - in order to enter into dialogue seriously and resolved . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="740"> mr president , commissioner , tomorrow , a year after our last debate here in parliament , on the subject of morocco . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="741"> i wish the commissioner and success and i welcome the presence of the moroccan side yalta did .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="743"> there is nothing to add except that the fishermen do not understand the situation and that they are extremely disappointed that the negotiations on the agreement with morocco , is taking time . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="744"> mr president , we are dealing with the third in agreement with morocco , which is of interest to most of all our friends in spain and portugal , which provide the bulk of the fleet , even if some of the french and a couple of swedish are also involved . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="745"> it is basically the easiest of championing the suburbs , to defend the other is morocco . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="746"> it is not able to contain , given the fact that it arrives in three days to be fighting a key date for negotiations , but , precisely because of the close relationship that deadline , which is key , it must be careful as to the drafting of this resolution . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="747"> we are talking about an area which does not belong to the moroccan side but which is administered by morocco . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="748"> mr president , this is not the first time that the right to do it again in moroccan waters sahariennes appears on the agenda . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="749"> firstly , it is worth emphasising that the fisheries agreement with morocco is by far the most important of the european union , accounting for over 30 % of all of the catches of the community fleet in the waters of third countries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="750"> mr president , commissioner , i shall not repeat what has been said in the house this morning and which claims to be almost a year . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="751"> history shows us that we are talking here about the neighbours who have often been identified even with a difficult time with one another , and the idea of establishing a european union is to overcome such problems neighbourhood 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="752"> i believe that if we manage to give to the moroccan side a european orientation is , morocco will also touch on matters pending , and it will discuss with us the question of natural resources , which are of common resources , and that there can devote more precedence to vessels from third countries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="753"> thank you commissioner . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="754"> it is not a question to language teachers , but an example , the way in which is performing in practical terms is a europe of citizens .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="758"> mr president , politicians have suffered the problem . at times , given the task which has been difficult to say to their electorate that , in spite of the documents and about the rightness morale undeniable of their , there is yet another grievance sometimes before the courts .

<p><seg id="760"> to date , the european commission can now be done away with the way forward is not shown itself willing to apply the treaties in cases where the number of people affected is reduced .

<p><seg id="762"> we are once again in the middle of an infringement procedure and we hope that the court of justice will give its opinion as soon as possible .

<p><seg id="763"> that said , i hope that our debate will help to promote a solution that is fair to the language teachers to italy .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="767"> so it is simply to bring something to the vote . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="768"> mr barÃ³n crespo , i would like to be sure that you understand .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="772"> the fight against money laundering is naturally an important priority for the union , as has quite rightly , that is specified in last year at the summit in tampere . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="773"> in conclusion , parliament has considered very carefully and courteous this portuguese initiative that , but we are not satisfied with the limited scope of the revision of the europol convention have been proposed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="774"> article 6 is concerned , his view , allows the extension of the requests complementary of support , and by means of article 7 of the introduction of tax are no longer acceptable to the refusal of a mutual legal assistance . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="775"> that is why i support the proposals put forward but i take this opportunity to announce that a very lively discussion is about to commit the near future the council about the common position on the second directive on combating money laundering . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="776"> if &apos; the european police force &apos; rule has been receiving this gift from heaven d self-control achievable , it will make every attempt to curb the vague desire for democratic control of the european parliament in view the current shortcomings in the sphere of the structure and the lack of unity on the substance . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="777"> i am delighted at this debate , 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="778"> this must be done by means of a majority vote , while we are proposing a two-thirds majority - and we also want to see parliament be involved in the executive director , if necessary , by a vote to a two-thirds majority . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="779"> he would at the support of the public and it is necessary for the future . 
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="781"> this report contains a visa on the appeal of geneva , for whom the ppe group is going to vote , not because we are opposed to the geneva appeal , but simply because , as parliament , we must ensure that there is legislation for quality . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="782"> let us not forget , however , it is to provide europol in workforce and with adequate financial resources to ensure that europol should be able to assume the responsibilities which him transfer yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="783"> this framework decision aims at fighting organised crime , which is at the origin of money laundering , and not in opposition to the minor offences implications penal lower levels , which might lead to distortions of the objective of this framework decision if they should be considered in this context . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="784"> that is where the states , thanks to the police and judicial cooperation , can intervene with the most effective way to combat organised crime . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="785"> however , in all honesty , i believe that this initiative is not the ideal opportunity to take decisions on this matter . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="786"> the picture may look gloomy , but there is reason to hope pact ! 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="787"> mrs gebhardt &apos;s report pays particular attention to these three points . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="788"> the member states of the european community to be observed on the basis of their systems legislative , executive and judiciary , in accordance with the principle of fundamental rights and common values . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="789"> we , too , like mrs palacio , we hope that this unit of judicial cooperation will be relying soon d be provisional , but , as radical members , we are not willing to renew the experience gained with europol , when the constitution of the unit &apos; drugs &apos; has given rise to the creation of an superorganisme fast-changing and expansion , and which is beyond the democratic control of the national parliaments constant and european parliament . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="790"> it must be based on talks of commons and given a broad political support . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="791"> without a degree of cooperation , we will not be able to maintain the rule of law in the european union , which applies the principle of free movement . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="792"> criminals should not be in doubt on their very nature supranational . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="793"> the commission welcomes your report , mrs gebhardt . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="794"> and this work for the follow-up , in fact , precisely , part , although in this case , there actually a little late . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="795"> finally , concerning the fisheries industry â€“ which is a hobbyhorse of mine - , i assume that all three sides will make every effort to guarantee a positive development in the future . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="796"> one only has to suggest that we need to review the whole procedure , not only with regard to the court &apos;s annual report to be published tomorrow , but also with regard to the special reports , such as these . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="797"> i would like to highlight only a few points which are crucial , in my view , for our future cooperation for control of the expenditure relating to research in general . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="798"> i would stress , however , for a fraud or misappropriation wasn were observed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="799"> however , i would point out one point is that a financial burden should be a joint is not practicable strictly speaking within the framework programme , which is intended to form consortia composed of various bodies , universities , smes and large enterprises , research institutions public or private . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="800"> therefore , the procedure is set in motion , but we are entering the field of jurisdiction of member states . here , we are not always the masters of deadlines . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="801"> approval of the minutes of the previous sitting 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="802"> madam president , allow me first of all , as a member from salzburg to offer you my heartfelt thanks for your words of condolence and reasons of comfort to which you have worked out yesterday . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="803"> i believe that , if we want to ensure that this charter is the foundation stone of a european constitution , it must be complementary to the future . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="804"> so , these are obviously a major political decision and of a new opportunities to show the citizens of europe the full extent of this initiative . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="805"> the charter is , then , a text which is entirely consistent . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="806"> i am sure that the members of the convention , and this will be here at all will be able to confirm this . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="807"> i listened carefully to the rapporteurs once again that the charter will be the prelude to a constitutional treaty and it is known that i , for my part , in favour of this . but i would like to remind you , because we have kept to a time when great precision in light of what is happening today , whether in biarritz , the european council was only able to find that a majority of member states were not prepared to discuss , at least for the moment , the integration of the charter into the treaties . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="808"> on behalf of my group i would expressly like to thank not only all the members of my group and , more especially , ingo friedrich , vice-president of parliament , which has brought our business . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="809"> the european union today is much more than an economic community , 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="810"> that is our proposal . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="811"> it took a few weeks as labelling is the right to strike . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="812"> secondly , it fills a gap in the protection of fundamental rights of people living in the union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="813"> we therefore believe that the charter is important , as a point of principle , just because she is launching a debate and a debate that we think it would be appropriate for the future , but that needs to develop further , to be held in parallel with the unification process . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="814"> one can figure out behind the vote on the charter to a programme aimed at establishing the first part of a constitution for what could be called the united states of europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="815"> but we want a europe which is flourishing , prosperous europe that would increase , which is why we wanted and have to comment on the roots . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="816"> this scope , i want to say something about this . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="817"> allied to the fact that we can bring some sort of discrimination , that respect is the basis on which will also be able to rely , subsequently , the measures designed to guarantee the position of minorities . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="818"> in life is concerned , nothing is perfect . all interested parties to state the rights , but as not to defend them actually matter is not the perfect either . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="819"> it is never too late . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="820"> the present charter seems to me that , be a poor copy of it . it creates the confusion which come into the legal affairs , for example when it says , in paragraph 2 of article 2 nobody may be condemned to death &apos; â€“ here , so good â€“ , and add &quot; or be executed ; 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="821"> a further comment to the chairman of the council : as a former member of a high court , i can assure you that the overlapping of powers of various jurisdictions extremely swiftly jurisprudence diverging will result , and it is possible therefore anticipate that different approach . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="822"> the reference to article 6 seems logical and i believe that the council presidency must take notice of what mr barÃ³n . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="823"> this is an important message to send to the present time , given the fragile political situation in one or other member state . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="824"> this charter of social rights is a step backwards in relation to the legislation of many member states and , out of this game postponements , will serve as an instrument which is to amend it and nor can they undermine it ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="825"> mr president , the charter lays emphasis on the existing rights , whilst at the same time , working in europe is a historic breakthrough . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="826"> mr president , the proposal and the approval of the draft charter of fundamental rights should find a consensus rather broader . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="827"> attack memo moreover , the trade union rights y are omitted , and considers that the text , basically , is intended to establish the free movement of capital . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="828"> thus , this charter , offer additional protection to the citizens are most vulnerable in our european society , which is good . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="829"> firstly , they must include a reference to the charter into article 6 of the ec treaty . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="830"> for many years it was discussed the possibility of the european union to accede to the european convention on human rights , as is the case of its member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="831"> mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the charter which we are about to vote with conviction europeanist certainly represents a step on the road towards the construction of a political europe in which we believe firmly . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="832"> it is important not to destroy the authority of both bodies . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="833"> my colleagues in the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights , i have had the honour of being appointed rapporteur on the respect for human rights in the union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="834"> the charter has many followers but also many enemies , and this means that we have listened to the critics of those who do not want a political europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="835"> in both as the text would be too restrictive , or even too late in relation to some of the reforms that it would be liable to break up , and for others it would be as empty or insufficiently binding . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="836"> i would remind you that the etuc , for example , which has gone unheeded , accounts for 60 million people in europe , many hundreds of ngos have been consulted , that of citizens , quite simply have been able to provide as their contribution , and that some of their proposals were accepted by the convention . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="837"> the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="838"> our parliament must , within this forum , and during its debates , has been made clear to our turkish partners that they should not be afraid of any european interference in their internal affairs , but we are offering them a contract in the process of having more precise definition , on the occasion of the accession partnership is , commissioner , and of course with the charter of fundamental rights . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="839"> if we had wanted to make the conditions , should have been done last year on the occasion of the earlier decision . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="840"> i believe that this excellent report by mr morillon , bears witness to the desire to have the capacity to take this process of rapprochement of turkey , with a sense of a major and legitimate to be alert to the reforms that are still considerable because this country has yet to take . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="841"> mr president , mr president-in-office , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by thanking most warmly mm . morillon and mr seppÃ¤nen for their very constructive and wise when it comes to policy and say that this debate is taking place in a very favourable , at a time when we are indeed able to increase the impact on the relations between the european union and turkey , perhaps , be decisive stage yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="842"> i confirm again that we have to be concerned about the inadequate respect for human rights and minority rights , that we have to be concerned about the role assigned to the army by the constitution , that we remain deeply concerned about the situation of the population of kurdish origin and the state of emergency which is held within the four province south-east . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="843"> on this point , i largely agree with mr morillon &apos;s report . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="844"> bearing in mind that this special programme of eur 450 million , of which the union will permit them to be 65 % , it says that , on the basis of the provisioning rate of 9 % , the figure is expected to be sacked from the reserve to the guarantee fund is only eur 26 million , there would be relevant budgetary qu in the event of failure to payment , because it would have to appeal to the guarantee . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="845"> at a meeting which has unfortunately been able to take part , the majority of my group has decided to support the proposal for amendments or amendment no 25 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="846"> the morillon report and the accession to the partnership commits the european community in turkey &apos;s candidacy . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="847"> that is , i propose that the european parliament is organising a debate on the genocide in armenia , the majority will follow through and we will the debate in turkey . prolongerons 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="848"> any other route that will benefit from those who , in the eu and turkey , do not want membership . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="849"> mr president , the morillon report is , by itself , perfectly illustrate the contradictions of the central european approach has to be made of turkey .

<p><seg id="852"> i would point out that , being carried that great power of control over the new data bases in europe for an organ monocratique respectfully and trust that we must at controller â€“ puts me seems to be a moment to see us vis-Ã -vis the central position of the human being that , faced with the power technology , must have a reference framework of rights and freedoms that are guaranteed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="853"> yet , we need to adopt a set of rules governing the data protection , because the institutions &apos; treatment not only data in-house ( such data on their activities , to their budget and the relationship autonomous rating ) but also of the data on citizens gathered in the framework of the performance of tasks of the eu , for example , the granting of subsidies , the survey on the marketing world competition , public contracts , the work and study after study statistics , the data on the preparation and implementation of legislative texts seppÃ¤nen ) .

<p><seg id="886"> and when we launched the partnership , in 1995 , we have , furthermore , knowledge that we engage with the long-term future . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="887"> mr brok â€™ refers to the financial resources . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="888"> mr president , the fact that the president-in-office has already answered the questions that i did not even put to it demonstrates their talents . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="889"> we should try to help to give the people of palestine , the good fortune to be committed to its own development , their own future and the birth of her own country by means of an agreement with israel and on the basis of the security of the state of israel . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="890"> in fact , we have closed the negotiations with egypt eighteen months ago and i would now like to move quickly to the implementation of the agreement and then to its signature complete in due course . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="891"> over the next few years , the success of this partnership will be of even more important than ever before and i hope that this week , in marseilles , and the coming weeks that follow , we will be able to ensure that this whole undertaking acquire an even greater impetus and energy has been the case in the past . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="892"> there is confirmation that the bilateral aspect on which it is difficult to negotiate , which was long in ratification and for now the dominant , threatens to shape it increasingly economies of those countries according to their trade with the union , which impedes the development of the south-south dimension because of the difficulties experienced by the partner countries to establish cooperation links between them . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="893"> a few days ago , at meetings of the circle of savings to barcelona , the secretary-general of the council , mr solana , we were told that the priorities of the external european activities , first of all , were the countries around us . yet , our initial neighbouring are the mediterranean . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="894"> secondly , we must increase the envelope of regional and relationships across trade exchanges , but also environmental protection , combating terrorism and drug trafficking , migration and integration , and progress on the human rights , as we have asked for . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="895"> ( the president cut the speaker off ) 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="896"> under these circumstances , it should be possible to arrive at the extraordinary summit in marseilles , an agreement which does not confine itself to be aware of new dividing lines in the eu . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="897"> if current trends continue , there are some reasons to be pessimistic . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="898"> mr president , returning to the middle east conflict , there is less than two months ago the president of parliament , of israel and that of the house have , in this chamber , palestinian been united in their hands with those of the president of the european parliament for an appeal to the peace and harmony , and members have been united welcoming fervently this gesture . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="899"> in marseilles also , the other summit , there were members from the association of unions and political organisations , by all the sides of the mediterranean . the latter group who were jointly explicit answers to the needs of their people . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="900"> the debate is closed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="901"> however , i wish to find in two major areas of policy . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="902"> very specifically , the reduction of their presence on the governing board of the agency . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="903"> it is vital that the ngos participate but also that they act with a degree of coordination between them has , if we want their actions may be effective and that it should also be extended - everywhere in the regions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="904"> at the same time , to provide it with a content and significance of cultural areas , not in abstract terms or generic medicines , but in terms of solidarity , we have tabled amendments that have received a positive reception in the committee on industry . in my opinion , these amendments would make it possible to characterise the economic aid and civil in solidarity with the return of regions affected to a reality and to a quite as life , but just a possibility to solidarity cultural and institutional , and i must stress this last point - on institutional affairs , for these regions will feel themselves bound to europe , but also a civil , in terms of cultural initiatives . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="905"> i also believe that we will need to avoid the duplication between the governing board and the council for the management and the meetings are not necessary or are members of these , while the ritual director accountable must nevertheless take the necessary decisions at the appropriate time . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="906"> in one year , while the crisis in kosovo is still fresh in our minds a great deal of progress has been made , and the internal dynamics of a number of countries strengthens ultimately the role of the international community yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="907"> their fate political answers will depend , among other things in the success of the aid of the european union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="908"> we are pursuing in this way of two objectives : firstly , the development of regional cooperation and , secondly , the establishment of a genuine policy of rapprochement between these countries and the european union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="909"> we hope that we are more efficient and quick in implementing the programmes that the commission may bring dÃ©lÃ©guera implementation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="910"> he is well established , but at the same time , was excellent in its relations with other leaders in the region . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="911"> tariffs as they are asked , at the european council and within the framework of the report on the development of european capacities for military and civil crisis management , that mechanisms for financing , for example the commission &apos;s creation of rapid fund rapid-response are winning instituted , so that there is a constant fast track of the activities of the european union in order to contribute to the operations carried out by other international organisations and to fund , where necessary , the activities of ngos . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="912"> the constant postponement of the referendum the reported failure of negotiations in berlin on 28 september last , give rise to considerable concern and great disappointment among the population . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="913"> whatever the outcome of the referendum , the independence of or the return to morocco , it seems to me that this is the democratic path , and therefore effective , which will enable us to resolve , at the conflict . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="914"> the transport of nuclear materials , in france is carried out in accordance with the relevant legislation . this applies to the directive no 94 / 55 / eec , of the 21 november 1994 , on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road , and the directive no 96 / 49 / eec of 23 july 1996 on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by rail , which apply to the transport of nuclear materials and fix diverse technical requirements in relation now to the vehicles , trademarks and packaging . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="915"> the union uses furthermore every means at its disposal within the framework of the pca in order to contribute to improving relations between the two countries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="916"> the feira european council in june , has asked the council a accelerate implementation of measures to combat the criminal networks that are laid down in the conclusions of the european council in tampere in october 1999 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="917"> i can confirm the interpretation which is made by mr martin , but to fight against criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings , and not to return to the texts of tradition , which allow the refugees to exercise their right to ask for asylum on potentials union territory . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="918"> the council remain , however , concerned because of these crimes which are frequently conducted under intolerable conditions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="919"> not this evening , and that brings me to the answer because i know of the minister and i shall make you an answer from the council . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="920"> as to the tour of the state president , the president of the republic , jacques chirac , then of course , it will all end in vienna , it is clear . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="921"> that said , i should like to say , madam , for i love austria , and which i love the austrians in general . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="922"> can the council , therefore , like to indicate what the response he is making to the point of the letter from mr cem whichever side it maintains that this or that is involved in the partnership agreement to the cyprus issue and would set back eu-turkey relations and that this association in the face of the conditions set in helsinki ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="923"> we face a situation where i would like to ask the minister has to say about this . first of all , in the conclusions of helsinki , it says that the solution to the cyprus issue is not a precondition for the accession of cyprus . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="924"> the agreement will take into account too , of the need to ensure the sustainable use of resources and the need to facilitate the development of the sector of fisheries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="925"> the agreement that morocco is proposing would be two years instead of five , and it wants , moreover , that the european union continues to give the 21 000 million pesetas that it pays in currently . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="926"> question no 13 by ( h-0854 / 00 ) : 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="927"> mr president , on a point of order , it remains 20 minutes before the end of question time and , as we are very few members present , we are not in danger of being late . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="928"> as for the energy efficiency , the commission presented a plan of action at the meeting of the council last may . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="929"> the aim of the european union on cuba , as drawn up in the common position on cuba , which was adopted by the council on 2 december 1996 , is to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , along with an increase , and a long-term increase in prosperity of the cuban people .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="932"> commissioner , ladies and gentlemen of the few members , who have found a way back to this house . i would like to start by warmly congratulating the rapporteurs , and particularly the present rapporteur , for her work and for the excellent cooperation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="933"> nor must we , indeed , does not spend our money , if the will to achieve the objectives that have been lacking pact ! 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="934"> i think that it forms a framework of political initiatives which we should continue working so that we can make any new plans . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="935"> the member states are making great declarations of intent , which must be followed by a financial commitment too specific . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="936"> both proposals are given temporarily to meet two key priorities of the european union , and provide aid for south-east europe and provide this aid as quickly and effectively as possible . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="937"> the european parliament can be proud of these results of its own . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="938"> clearly we can accept in essence , being , and provided for changes to be made in some cases to their wording , amendments nos 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 and 7 , the first part of 11 , the first part of 13 , 16 in part , on 17 , 18 , 19 in part , on 20 , 21 , on 24 , the first part of the 28 , 31 and bull 37 in part . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="939"> thank you , commissioner . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="940"> they have committed themselves to promote and protect fundamental human rights and to monitor the implementation of democracy , rule of law , equality , justice and the environment . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="941"> finally , the leaders , have decided to press for a stepping up contacts interparliamentary as contemplated in the framework of cooperation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="942"> it is positive , i really must stress this - that there has been agreement on a framework for cooperation between asia and europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="943"> with regard to carrying made programme , we find it incomprehensible that its office to have its seat in seoul . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="944"> this control must be transferred to a body clearly community so that the common fisheries policy should apply to all member states and to all ships and professional , independent of their nationality , thereby avoiding any risk of non-compliance with the principle of equal treatment . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="945"> that would , firstly , that we do not restrict ourselves to respond to such an action such as that of the agreement of galapagos and his clear aim to widen unilaterally waters jurisdictional by four countries , regardless of the minimum standards of international law of the sea or from the attempts of expulsion arbitrary community fleets , some of the few that carry with them of the standards and regulations . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="946"> the development of the regionalisation of the cfp will be crucial for the development of local actions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="947"> we support the regional fisheries organisations , we ask for more regional fishing organisations , and that the commission any more weight . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="948"> we are in an extremely difficult position , which is simply to try to strike a balance . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="949"> the commission is keeping to the conclusion of its communication : as regards the work of scrutiny , nafo is an exception in this regard , it cannot become the norm . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="950"> pigmeat ( coms ) 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="951"> the commission is proposing in relation to that to include in the com , a new tool that the funds regulation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="952"> the last increase which has grown in the middle of 1998 at the beginning of 2000 , has caused a fall in prices that are more than 30 % . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="953"> the sector of the pig industry is the only sector to having been able to adapt , until now to the conditions of the market with relatively interventionism highly questionable , such as export refunds and the issue of private storage , and it should remain this way . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="954"> this is a proposal that the americans have already acted . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="955"> this aspect is fair and credible degree . i would advise my group not to oppose the report . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="956"> far be this way to create a system which is exceptional in terms of common practice , international , people are getting closer , the opposite is true , with this mechanism should be flexible , and to the low cost for the prevention and crisis management , and what applies to certain third countries and the systems of the usa and canada . income 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="957"> in future , the funds regulatory noncompulsory will help , in my opinion , to balance the market in the pigmeat sector as they have done in other areas . as 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="958"> mr president , it must prove that it be well in this debate is that it highlights what the common agricultural policy , can regulate and what it cannot ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="959"> the changing market shows us that the cycle of pigs are still under way , that it is still a reality , and also that the emphasis away times better . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="960"> in particular , we should not forget that , in many countries the farmers themselves piglets producing keep , and that they have thus direct access to the fund regulator pigs off fertilizers they sell . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="961"> the debate is closed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="962"> since the last discharge , the court has adopted 24 special reports , which outlined the outcomes audit with the emphasis placed on a wide range of specific areas in which the community financial management can be improved . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="963"> this reflection leads me to make a few comments on the reform of the commission . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="964"> the european court of auditors is right in very substantial demands on the use of taxpayers &apos; money . the commission can count on these standards in order to reform financial management . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="965"> i emphasise , of course , have been placed on the fact that it is the duty of the european commission to avoid the mistakes as official and fighting fraud , especially now that you wonder always where the boundaries are located , exactly , and if all the things to be confused yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="966"> the report from mrs schreyer , was equally interesting . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="967"> we have to find a solution and i put the following question : could we contemplate a correction of the accounts for 1999 , mrs schreyer ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="968"> we are told that it is not possible to calculate . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="969"> we might , once and for all we can say : &apos; these are the problems and we wish to come up with solutions . &apos; 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="970"> the member states to protect themselves . all they defraud , they are failing in some form of control , and each time that the criticism has been expressed , are coming to brussels . in other words to the committee and elsewhere . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="971"> i want to appeal to the ministers as well as to the heads of state and government to do this to ensure that we can agree in nice the proposal to create a european public prosecutor . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="972"> the present report mentions several opportunities to management procedures and adequate control , a lack of planning , evaluation inappropriate , for criteria for eligibility waves , or even not exist . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="973"> i thank the court of auditors , please , for which to deliver its opinion rapidly on the reform of the financial regulation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="974"> but i think that the court of auditors has failed to do its work well enough to be able to help us in our part of our task . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="975"> the whole process will take time . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="976"> the seriousness of this title , is based on a press conference , mr friedmann , and i ask you , mr karlsson , why the members of the court of auditors by different depending on whether they apply to the committee on budgetary control , or in public to the press . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="977"> i would like to congratulate the commission and commissioner schreyer in particular and the court has in fact pointed out that many of the changes that it had requested are implemented or are about to be one . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="978"> finally , mr karlsson , while we are proceeding with all of that within parliament , perhaps you could go to the united states to assist with the counting of votes . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="979"> it has been asked , as i have been reminded of it today many times before â€“ that the court is to name explicitly those states where fraud and irregularities reported to have been discovered . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="980"> the documents are of high quality , which start up &apos; a stone into the water &apos; of the common agricultural policy , which is still favouring the large farmer at the expense of smaller countries , countries and regions of central europe to the detriment of countries and peripheral regions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="981"> i am extremely pleased . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="982"> on this particular point , it is quite clear that the court of first instance , has given us its support when she said that we had not only the right to mention the names , but which we have also to do so . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="983"> thank you , mr president karlsson . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="984"> another paragraph , which we want to see an end to the commissioner relates to the professional secrecy and said that the duty of confidentiality must be subject to the effectiveness of services of the control and monitoring of dangerous products . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="985"> consequently , we have paid a different opinion here and most of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market can only lend advise the plenary of follow including amendments 38 and 41 , which would reduce the restriction of export . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="986"> one example : in many areas , products are no longer assembled by the manufacturer , but handed over for spare parts to the furniture in the cash dispenser . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="987"> in the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , we voted in favour , under the good advice of our rapporteur , a series of amendments , that once again my group recommends that a block to the house today . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="988"> our amendments nos 1 , 8 and 9 relate to this point . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="989"> a proposal was made in order to remove the amendment with notably preamble the protection of professional secrecy and the fact that producers can only work auto-incriminer yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="990"> furthermore , the very nature of the provision of services lends itself - less so . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="991"> mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur for his report which addresses the fundamental concerns of the consumer associations , which must be accepted as partners count in constructive dialogue . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="992"> in other areas , this directive has been extended to include other areas of operation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="993"> although the review of the directive to be formally set by the directive itself , this approach also reflects the commission &apos;s desire to strengthen the protection of health and consumer safety . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="994"> this is also extremely important in terms of the industry , in order to maintain a level playing field between the various actors , particularly with regard to imported products . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="995"> the only change is that the distribution companies need to maintain and make available to the request of the competent authorities , and within the limits of their activities , the documentation necessary to determine the origin of products . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="996"> amendment 7 proposes some amendments of the references to the paragraphs . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="997"> this is , all in all aspects of civil law , regulated by the directive on product liability , and which i do not therefore need to be dealt with here . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="998"> this is unacceptable , given that these directives in general , there is a lack of measures relating to surveillance of the markets is the system of notification and so on . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="999"> this is unacceptable because this is a big improvement on the existing directive . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1000"> on 30 august 2000 , following a meeting of the office of the presidency , including myself , and where my own case has been discussed by a few , in my absence and to my close knowing it , mr barÃ³n crespo has informed me that i had auto-exclu of his group .

<p><seg id="1013"> in regard to the pig industry , we do not have to regulate the market which exist for other agricultural products .

<p><seg id="1021"> mr president , you know that there is now the news has spread amongst the fish , that i fully agree that they cause . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1022"> for the rapporteur , the answer is to give the community , it effectively , resources that will enable it to ensure the direct control of fishing activities .

<p><seg id="1025"> mr president , i agree with the support of at least a certain knowledge with the rapporteur , our colleague , mr blokland . the incineration perhaps is a source of pollution is an important one , but it is indeed now be necessary , given the very few of the recycling of waste . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1026"> firstly - and this is the most important - it will contribute significantly to reducing emissions of dangerous substances and polluting goods during the incineration of waste - in the agents of very dangerous to human health and the environment .

<p><seg id="1165"> i realise that the council was in july , a grave mistake , by stating that all documents servicemen were strictly confidential 
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="1192"> i am thinking of the nights freezing and wine-making cold days in winter in europe , and it is also in the north or south , where there are many older people , for lack of financial resources , are unfortunately forced to put out their heating to save money .

<p><seg id="1196"> the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1197"> we disagree only on article 5 of this resolution , but this is no divergence essential . we believe that by approving this extent the european parliament adopts a stance excessively paternalistic yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1198"> we believe , not only now but for the creation of the , who some people seek to diminish parlacen its competences , a weakening of its presence , because a parliament is always inconvenient , but i believe that the needs of the parlacen , along with the same way as us or that of other parliaments , is to be for ordinary people that it represents , beneficent even if it is embarrassing for the powers laid down . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1199"> this is one of the questions that raises , of course has left a feeling , not only in this chamber but unanimous practically being among the many members who , because of their origin , have been watching with great sympathy for the process of cooperation and consolidation of the institutions in countries that we regard as our own . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1200"> in our cooperation with the region , we paid particular attention to all the institutions able to support regional integration , the secretary-general of the system of integration of central america , the court of justice , more specifically the parlacen does our primary goals yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1201"> for that reason , our concern and sorrow were very large when will we have seen a slow shipwreck political , economic and human activity in that country , which has been orchestrated by the military regime of general gueÃ¯ . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1202"> in so bankruptcy , the current model of cÃ´te d &apos;ivoire , the responsibility of the west is evident thors was overwhelming . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1203"> the leaders are now a new chance and let us therefore take it . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1204"> the european union must also make sure that none of its members , based , with his former colonies - and i emphasize this - of relations based solely on economic interests or racks geo-strategic yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1205"> when the supporters of watara descendirent out onto the streets in order to call for more elections , protests have been very badly repressed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1206"> the european union has a duty and the situation has also declared itself willing to contribute to these elections are conducted in a peaceful , fair , free and transparent for elections in december and to local elections are held in january . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1207"> mr president , the european union has recently reported , in various declarations , the excesses of the regime of general gueÃ¯ and has also expressed regret at the exclusion of the will of the main candidates of the opposition of the elections on 22 october , which has a limited , in large part , exclusion , the credibility of this electoral process .

<p><seg id="1209"> mr president , during the october part-session , commissioner patten told me , whereas it was in response to my question about burma , that if the situation worsened in the country , the implementation of the meeting between the eu and asean , and 11 and 12 december , is called into question . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1210"> in reality , as has already been said , the situation in burma is in the process to worsen . it is extraordinary that a democratic leader of such importance as aung san suu kyi , is continuing to be subject to persecution and that the democratic league so that it cannot act in the usual re-establish democracy and , more so when this country continues to be investment economic benefit from that point , to the lack of freedom , the lack of union rights .

<p><seg id="1211"> i know that the idea of us know tambouriner the gates of that regime calamitous thors was vicious bilateral tiny comfort and hope very much that the suggestions made by both mr deva and mrs kinnock , will be accepted and respected by the commission .

<p><seg id="1213"> it is one of our partners . that is why we cannot continue to remain silent on the situation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1214"> we have adopted this resolution and we were able to note that she had given rise to a few minor improvements . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1215"> israel is on this one of the examples of this most blatant in world history , which show that things are not so simple . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1216"> just think , too , to a denial of the recommendations of the special rapporteur of the united states , calling for the religious intolerance , the lack of free expression of opinion and to the censure of media attention has now been created . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1217"> the commission fully shares the concerns of members and has come round to the many criticisms voiced today categorically the manner in which the military regime has a habit of deny all the principles contained in the universal declaration of human rights . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1218"> i fully share the concern of some members about the problems that they have described and , although some 23 000 people have already been released employing amnisties general we have to continue to be concerned with people who are still being detained for their political beliefs or religious nature . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1219"> the vote will take place at 5.30 p.m. 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1220"> the eu has a unique opportunity to break new ground in these changes and to promote a society that is environmentally sustainable , in which we would not have to face up to the floods was partly due to our own inability to accept the consequences of such action . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1221"> the commission must make haste to use energy and its funds in order to ensure that those affected by the floods in the regions most disaster-struck support immediately , and this by means of instruments , such as the erdf and the eaggf guarantee section . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1222"> taking into consideration her absolutely exceptional for the disaster , the thrust of the resolution put forward together on the other groups , is perfectly justified , even if there are already taken up recently -the 26th â€“ one of the house on these issues and that a resolution of parliament has also been adopted on this occasion . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1223"> as you know , we face a fundamental problem : the legal basis to act . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1224"> the next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1225"> mr president , i really am very concerned about this issue and have heard many debates on this subject , not only in the committee on employment and social affairs by the committee on economic and monetary affairs . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1226"> i understand that this addition can count on the approval of the other groups . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1227"> we believe that the objective should be to strengthen both the health care that the system of social protection , and to ensure substantial the concept of universal service , thanks to the medical attention and measures for the prevention of high quality at every single citizen , paying particular attention to the inhabitants of remote areas , including rural areas , within the framework of a public system unique insurance sanitary and society . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1228"> however , i would stress the fact that all the other measures for health protection are not the responsibility of the european union , but of the member states and that health care systems will continue to be the exclusive competence of member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1229"> the remainder of what it proposes to take is to heal the wounds that caused by that decision . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1230"> at least , the majority of my group voted against and we also ensured that the vote on the report should not take place during the last plenary session . however , be postponed until today . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1231"> this means that , if we manage to conclude our work at first reading with the council and with the help of the commission , it goes without saying that we can do so . however , we shall not give up from the start of our rights . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1232"> but let it really possible that , let us assume that the referee should fail to be sold to the enemy and accept the idea that the texts of the commission and the rapporteur is in keeping with a real problem and a growing problem , in the words , and that the simultaneous nature of these comments , with those of the basel committee will either be the case for further development . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1233"> however , it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create most new jobs and which are maintaining the majority of jobs which already exist . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1234"> that is why it is important not to reject what goes on in basel , although it is clear that we have a legislative process of their own . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1235"> the way in which we must manage to maintain the current institutional balance is , for us , a fundamental point in this process . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1236"> the house will be prepared to forgive me , whereas in the evening is the end of this parliamentary sitting , i now come to go to draw my inspiration to a certain melancholy well to home . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1237"> the public must have the confidence in the strongest possible in the ombudsman , and be sure that it is fair in its investigations . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1238"> i would like to thank mrs almeida garrett for her commitment to this important matter . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1239"> in the past , the ombudsman , that we have just discussed , has received many complaints about the lack of transparency has been expressed in the opportunities for staff recruitment . and it is a major problem because we fully share the opinion of the ombudsman according to which a procedure for recruitment constitutes very often the first contact with young people of the union with the european institutions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1240"> if there is lack of coherence , the applicant must have the right to point out . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1241"> we must not help to fix a devices that can apply to institutions as varied as the commission or the court of justice . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1242"> the petitions committee has taken note of the fact that the european commission has informed the mediator implemented the recommendation , as of 1 july 2000 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1243"> these are amendments clear , and very thoughtful pragmatic which represent a real reform . in other words the only reform which is worthy of the name for the european institutions should take with regard to the procedures for staff recruitment . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1244"> a process of selection transparent , and without recourse to the confidentiality or incommunicado indicates in a democracy that can be confident in it . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1245"> for example , there is already a way that the candidates have a serious challenge before questionnaires of examination , that the general criteria for assessment will have to be available to the candidates and , upon request , that the list of candidates from stakeholders or the composition of the jury competitions should be published in the official journal , in the case of open competitions and upon the commission &apos;s website , where today competitions or restricted . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1246"> only a few months ago , president prodi said that this option would be to all support , as of july 2000 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1247"> for this we are in the minutes . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1248"> ( applause ) 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1249"> agreed , therefore , for a weighting highest â€“ for example , a 10 % - and that is being fully in any case , in all circumstances . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1250"> in my view , we can be proud , as the european parliament for having placed the question of a european police college on track . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1251"> we know that some member states still support the establishment of the college as merely a permanent network of national institutes , but we assume that the majority accepts this proposal as a step which would contribute to the creation of an institution in the time limit of three years . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1252"> the dutch word politieacademie reminds me of a long-running u.s. tv comical sur the police . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1253"> let us be sure , if we have a european police college , which it may be , as highlighted in the report by mr posselt , founded on the need to develop and promote respect for human rights and civil rights in the culture of our police . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1254"> as long as this aspect has not been clarified , i must say frankly that i cannot even have to approve the principle . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1255"> i note that the rapporteur wants to change the term &apos; senior members of the services responsible for implementing the legislation &apos; , then an &apos; senior members of the services responsible for implementing the legislation , using its own remit police â€™ , which is probably a good idea . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1256"> for me , who come from a political environment , it is very interesting to hear him say once more , with the same hysterical wuori similar concerns . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1257"> one might call it in the police - fresh , but she managed to heal the wounds of civil war and to show people the idea of the law and order . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1258"> rather than a police force , trained and organised on a small scale , constantly nourished by the recognition of signals from society in which she has to work . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1259"> the commission is prepared to do just that , if it has decided that . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1260"> it is particularly important to emphasise that the european police college , which came into office is planned for 1 january 2001 . this is not simply a network of national institutes , destined to the training of police forces of the countries of the eu , but that it also means the applicant countries of central and eastern europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1261"> according to it that is to say , this is the right way , is now beginning to take europol guaranteed unless corrects quickly its course . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1262"> there are constitutional problems in some member states , particularly in germany and austria . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1263"> it is a fact that a europe without borders has contributed to the increased number of marriages between persons of different nationality originating of both the european union and from third countries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1264"> other than commissioners diverge unhappily a vengeance accumulated yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1265"> but if it is true that this is a major step forward in this light , it is equally true that i agree with what mrs banotti and others who think that its scope is limited to the protection of children from weddings recognized as such by the law . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1266"> could i ask you to clarify your view in relation to article 17 ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1267"> with regard to the proposals put forward by certain major federations , in respect of certain procedures , which are emerging in favour of a protocol to enable them to escape from the basic rules of the treaty , including those relating to the free movement and competition , it is worth noting that this exemption , as set out , would be manifestly disproportionate to the goals to be achieved . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1268"> the eu must not â€˜ phooey â€™ process and will say that is too bad if the ban on the transfer system cause irreparable damage to the football . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1269"> i would hope that before you overlook confers fresh powers on the commission , the commission to use the ones we have available . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1270"> provided that the details of its application are complying with the relevant rules , such a measure appears to be in line with current community law , which aims to eliminate the distortion of competition with important equitable mechanisms of a tax on the costs of infrastructure for road-transport workers and to harmonise the systems of deductions within the european union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1271"> perhaps it would be advantageous in time to say quite simply what the british one really has been proposed and also what it proposes , bearing in mind the crisis in the field of road transport in england and the other countries of the european union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1272"> when is an important proposal of this kind is being put forward , we in this house , should have the opportunity to discuss them and to debate it as soon as possible , not necessarily for the last time . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1273"> security is called for . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1274"> as regards your first point , mr miller , that proposal was mooted in the house by the president and it is parliament which has given its assent to the amendment of the agenda for today . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1275"> i agree that heavy goods vehicles of ireland are a special case . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1276"> i am expressing to his family and relatives and friends , with all those in spain , believe in the strength of democracy itself , my deepest sympathy . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1277"> i the note , mr dell &apos;alba . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1278"> in order not to make it possible that the mandate of the buenos aires plan of action , valid for at the conference . it expires ultimately without success , or without cop 6 a row , the parties have decided to suspend the cop 6 and to pursue the conference in may 2001 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1279"> in addition to the continuation of the coordination in the european union , we would have to intensify contacts with other parties . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1280"> many countries , and in particular , the groups , environmentalists looking upon this as an enormous amount of evasion . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1281"> the fact that the way out at the very least vocal up by mr prescott was necessarily a follow-up by new proposals from the americans that to keep to the position of the union shows that the french presidency was right to give up .

<p><seg id="1285"> the committee on the environment of this parliament has , in the past , been to respond to the problem of climate change . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1286"> but i do not wish to end up engaging in disputes over people , and avoid this kind of discussion totally negative .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1288"> moreover , i believe that those people in business and the economic actors , who take this problem seriously . and who would have liked us to have to provide for the rules of play , which are also losers . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1289"> in order to speak out clearly when we come to take stock , we can say that amongst the three sides , only the european union has reached an agreement and policy on climate change . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1290"> we must of course a few rules operational clear head regulating the market for the exchange of emission rights , which will reach a value of 12 000 million dollars . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1291"> the ministers are all aware that they cannot be excluded from the huge task of combating climate change ; it was also clear during the meeting of the hague . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1292"> the french president will come himself presenting to you on the presidency on 12 december . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1293"> all fifteen member states are now close to an agreement on the relaxing of closer cooperation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1294"> by contrast , the idea of a reference to the charter of fundamental rights in article 6 , the european parliament &apos;s position , in its recommendation of 14 november , and that we have also , as the presidency , on the table of the igc , was rejected by several member states . vigorously 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1295"> this we will have fulfilled the mandate laid down by the cologne european council and the union will have a reference is very strong , marking them clear , the rights and values which it is believed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1296"> at last , the nice european council will give you an overview of the priority that the french presidency attaches to economic and social issues and all the subjects on which the union can provide specific answers to the concerns of europeans . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1297"> furthermore , on the basis of the conclusions of feira , calling for the implementation of an action plan for an information society e-europe accessible to all , the council has been working on indicators of progress . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1298"> this debate has a number of aspects and i should like to outline three of them . firstly , the need to conclude the intergovernmental conference by the adoption of a treaty that really adds value . next , the aspect of our security policy that deals with crisis management , and finally , the need to mark out the route beyond nice . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1299"> there is much to be done before we have a reasonable solution . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1300"> we therefore need a new weighting of votes , according to which a majority of member states , which would represent not the majority of the population , will not be able to decide : action is that here , a democratic principle clear prevail . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1301"> i fully agree with president prodi that we have a historic opportunity which we must not waste . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1302"> my group , at this stage , would prefer a reweighting of votes , the double majority , but you have explained that there are other points are under consideration . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1303"> our group strongly supports the idea of the constitutionalisation of the founding treaties . this means that the treaty reform can take place without any transparency and involvement of civil society . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1304"> the strengthening of democracy would be necessary extension of the right of codecision by parliament . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1305"> let us not , tomorrow , with a new multilateral agreement on investment and the new negotiations on agriculture , after the seattle conference . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1306"> the internal policy and the policy of justice will be the subject of majority decisions , with effect from 2004 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1307"> mr president , nothing but the title of this item on the agenda already of the importance of article 133 evokes in the debate on the extension of qualified majority voting . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1308"> it is particularly sad to be allowed to get into a situation where the large and small countries are put in place against each other . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1309"> everyone must make an end of the way it is therefore clear that , in effect that the qualified majority to be available to allow the union to welcome new countries into membership . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1310"> parliament has also demonstrated that it is a good partner when drafting the charter , and it would be particularly heartened by the prime minister blair on recognises publicly . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1311"> if the summit in nice were to decide , for example , that the candidate countries can participate in the next european elections , that could help to put pressure on european union , so that enlargement becomes a reality .

<p><seg id="1312"> i will refrain from the citizens of the european areas , if we extend qualified majority voting to five areas which it will make important and which - the trade , social policy , the law , the internal affairs , the structural policy and taxation , to mention only the most important . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1313"> we are now facing the end of the progress made and the outcomes obtained did not escape , but we must be frank : in ten months of the intergovernmental conference on these important questions , opinions were swift to come closer together , mr vÃ©drine , there has not found , not to speak out because some understandings of the subjects which are mentioned by the parliament in its resolution of 13 april we earmarked were not dealt with , whether of the management of the economy or the institutional implications of a common military defence , 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1314"> governments have kept in mind the urgent nature of reforms for they are blinded by their own group in the new relationship between the powers . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1315"> mr president , i would like to remind the council and the commission , and clearly for parliament , the resolution on â€˜ better law-making â€™ , which we adopted on 26 october . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1316"> i believe that all the speakers are concerned about the outcome of the european council in nice . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1317"> finally , not only will the charter of fundamental rights is not included in the text of the treaty , but it is not even agree to make reference to rule 6 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1318"> if i have gathered in no way opposed to the aspirations and has , in fact , the rights of some of those countries wishing to join the community , in 2002 , it would not be , i believe , not in their interests , or in the interests of the member states to reach this stage , without that there are even ensures , firstly , an ordered transition , and that has led to a minimum of distortion in the economies of the current member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1319"> everyone will have to sacrifice some of its own exceptions chÃ©ries if we want to achieve a result in nice . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1320"> we know that a definitive solution must be found for the european elections in 2009 , that is for the legislature , which will go up , all in all , up until 2014 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1321"> i believe that at nice will need to be at least be able to accept the compromise position that in this parliament we are calling for , namely , the combination of the charter with article 6 ( 2 ) . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1322"> public opinion , be it in the eu and in the candidate countries will not accept the prospect of leftovers from nice and a second igc in 2004 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1323"> the european parliament blames everything trÃ©buchement yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1324"> if we consider at this point , mr president-in-office of the council , that the french presidency has been playing a decisive role in this , we must also be noted that a few days before the summit , we are still at a standstill . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1325"> apart from the overall picture of the forthcoming igc , a small detail , which has unfortunately important worries me . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1326"> despite this , i would like to point out , even if this exercise is very useful , since it raises a great deal to be fighting a few questions and suggestions that i think it is a pertinent the tone of these decisions which are too negative . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1327"> we are making every effort , if i may say so . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1328"> they accept the principle , however , that is how it must accept the prospect , but they are deeply involved democratic legitimate to be defended , and they can see that the conditions are not yet been met . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1329"> that is why it is so important to tighten up in nice , the community method , the value of the european institutions - council , parliament and commission - and the way to work together . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1330"> such a way of proceeding is violating the rules of this parliament , constitutes a blatant lack of courtesy towards a guest eminent and could have had very serious consequences yalta did .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1404"> all these proposals relate to the very essence of the regulations on maritime transport , and i would like to remind you that , in addition to the three proposals that have to be debated here today , the erika package ii , as mr gayssot else said , will be , for its part , been discussing this next week , and 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1405"> there has been since then , sadly , there are some other disasters at sea , as we know only too well . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1406"> thirdly , we state , and we are not , the only ones to do so , if a vessel hazardous should be detained only then to be allowed to go back into the sea . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1407"> i should like to add that the commission &apos; s initiative to present this position is important , because it has played such an extent as a sword of damocles , like , effective pressure on the imo in order to succeed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1408"> the other hand , of inspections will be imposed when the deadline is met by tax inspectors exclusive and specialised , precisely because they could not be any link with the ship owner , and that it does not have control over the classification of the vessel . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1409"> furthermore , although the direct dumping of materials to manufacturers , including the dumping of munitions servicemen considered as obsolete , is largely a practice which has been abandoned by member states , these weapons and materials industrialists still represent a real threat to the fishing industry and in some cases with a threat to security of men .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1412"> well then , please accept this proposal . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1413"> i therefore ask you , in turn , like to conclude this issue as quickly as possible in the council .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1416"> safety at sea , many european players is emphasised , is largely the result of deregulation and the practices of convenience . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1417"> how will we be able , in the midst of a french presidency of the union , to explain to our citizens that the european parliament has taken out the necessary measures for incentives and deterrents financial which they were proposed to accelerate the transition to double hulls . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1418"> concerning the responsibilities of the port state , we cannot continue to be complacent in the task of the port authorities . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1419"> i know that this is the text that the council is able to put up with , but are maximal are not going to contribute to its adoption in the hope that it will be improved at second reading . if we are not voting against because we acknowledge the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur , mr ortuondo , who has been taken over by a few compromise amendments show us the way to go at the next reading . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1420"> we are concerned it is first of all of the erika , but at the same time , a tanker sank elsewhere off turkey to be precise .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1425"> we might by then managed to avert a catastrophe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1426"> this , i believe , is the balance can be reached on the basis of the commission &apos;s proposals and the imo , and also of the reports under discussion for which the members who are the perpetrators far deserve to be congratulated . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1427"> the proof is that the measures adopted at international level to improve safety and reduce pollution adventitious have had a success .

<p><seg id="1432"> many of them . this represents are outside the port state control or are already covered by this directive or by another directive . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1433"> for reasons that are similar , the commission cannot agree with the new amendment no 22 , which refers to the important subject of the safety of shipping , but it has no place in the regulations being proposed .

<p><seg id="1481"> with regard to the considerations on the substance , let me give just one example . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1482"> we believe that this report must be thorough and , therefore , call upon to debate and vote on it in january . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1483"> yet , its presence is very important in this report , is partly why it is of great interest and of which their success depends to a greater part of the commission . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1484"> parliament &apos;s rules of procedure say that it is not meant to smoke in certain places , amongst which the house . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1485"> of the adaptation of the draft directive are needed , they are now presented . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1486"> let us hope that we can do that from now on . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1487"> if that does not happen again that the responsibility will be at least clear and well defined . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1488"> but , ladies and gentlemen , if you were really aware of the problem out tobacco vous exigeriez the banning of this drug , as you continue to keep up that of other substances , and yet in terms of quantity , much less . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1489"> also , amendment no 2 on carbon monoxide is a particularly important . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1490"> history teaches us that it is dangerous to assume the objective - which is so great and si virtuous that it may be - exceeds the rules . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1491"> mr president , i want to serve the workers in this sector . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1492"> and , although i was not here , it is clear that my vote was along those lines . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1493"> consequently , my concern , at the moment , is not so much on the problems of health , which are of course , are important and extensive , that on the restriction associated our acceptance of this extremely restrictive interpretation of the legislative power from the european parliament . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1494"> mr president , if it is truly a law on the success of the second reading , it will lead to a restriction on freedom of the industry on the one hand and greater protection of public health . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1495"> the results of research in this area are so clear that we cannot , as european legislators , do not keep up with these councils . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1496"> because of the decision of the court of justice , the council adopted a further condemnation of this position - and this time by a large majority . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1497"> we would also have had to be stopped . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1498"> the power of large tobacco industry is all too evident . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1499"> yet , and this is a disgrace to the european union , we call on our taxpayers to subsidise the cultivation of this awful substance to the tune of over eur 1 billion per year . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1500"> the procedure of the tests is ineffective . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1501"> this directive was introduced in order to take account of the conclusions of the valverde lÃ³pez report for 1997 by the european parliament , which was also mentioned many elements to be appointed under the present text , and called for a commission proposal . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1502"> that is why the need to regulate , in the interests of consumers â€“ is clear . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1503"> in this connection , let me say that , in terms of international rules and community , there is no exception for the words of the measures taken to protecting public health , and more particularly here , where the effects on the behaviour of all smokers are so considerable . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1504"> this relates to the issue of access to goods , especially when the distribution companies are located in places without supervision . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1505"> summer time 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1506"> we also face other problems that we would like to consider , like that of energy consumption and the health and safety , because they have report to summer-time ; but the argument which the strongest is still no doubt that we want to give the opportunity for the new member states to comply with our provisions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1507"> madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i note once again that the advantages and disadvantages of summertime are giving rise to discussions in greater depth . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1508"> our group believes that the proposal which has just been made is a good one ; he is right behind it and is the view that further amendments are not necessary . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1509"> another problem , there is , as agriculture , in the autumn , during political battages it indicates that rainfall in the morning is likely to have disappeared . surprisingly , the very nature does not adhere to the directive . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1510"> as regards the amendments which have been tabled , the commission has agreed with amendments nos 3 and 4 , whose aim is to make the system more transparent and to insist on the precautionary principle . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1511"> according to the european parliament , the compromises on which we accepted a considerable improvement in the council &apos;s common position . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1512"> children should be given of the medicines that have only been tested on adults , which meant that children are badly treated . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1513"> it can help improve clinical research in europe and therefore the welfare of the millions of patients . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1514"> this compromise , which can of course still be surpassed by each member state lays down a minimum threshold , which is aimed at preventing the appearance in the european union of a kind of dumping ethics which would provide the facility to a member state , but not to others , to carry out research on persons incapable of giving their informed consent . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1515"> finally , and in this connection i should like to express my disappointment that this provision has not integrated in the compromises proposed in the council , i think that the main with responsibility for the conduct of investigateur clinical trials has to be a doctor . here , since only doctors have knowledge and experience which will allow them to assess the benefits and to alleviate the undesirable effects and risks in the course of these tests . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1516"> the next item is the report ( a5-0377 / 2001 ) by mr trakatellis , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , on the proposal for a decision of the european parliament and council extending certain action programmes in the field of public health to community bodies , which were accepted by the decisions 645 candidates / 96 / ec , 646 / 96 / ec , 647 / 96 / ec , 102 / 97 / ec , 1400 / 97 / ec and 1296 / 1999 / ec and modifying these decisions . &#91; com ( 2000 ) 0448 - c5-0400 / 2000 - 2000 / 0192 ( cod ) ) . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1517"> perhaps , i would add , do we have opened a new method of operation in the field of codecision . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1518"> it is also a problem about which we believe that we note the weakness of the orientation of the european union , the council and the commission which , together with budgetary cuts , for not achieving the self-imposed ceiling of 1.27 % currently allowed under the existing rules , means that action such as this is permitted whereas coordination between the different member states on more and more important . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1519"> this is an area which can be taken into account in the context of the new community programme for public health which is due to begin shortly . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1520"> the text we are adopting today on the extension to six programs public-health reflects the agreements which are informal , with the institutions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1521"> all these factors , operating independently or a joint basis , which multiplies their effect , mean that every day , naturally , the millions of people cross the borders of their country of residence and move towards countries of the european union , to live there , working , studying or merely y travel . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1522"> the european union cannot accept that they receive different treatment depending on the member states in which they have been victims of the offence or according to nationality . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1523"> we should therefore consider whether it is reasonable to approve this draft . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1524"> indeed , we cannot seriously speak of a europe of citizens in isolation from the rights of victims . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1525"> the liberal group feels that a very good report has come out of the debates in committee , and will therefore support the amendments by the commission when we vote . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1526"> compensation for victims must come first , the payment of fines and excessive costs , of justice on the state . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1527"> i welcome the proposal from portugal to improve the basis of the victims in the criminal proceedings , even though i have every respect for the viewpoints legal considerations that have been outlined by mr lehne . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1528"> who would want to participate , especially by the vote , to a democracy which would leave aside the problems ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1529"> several amendments refer to the official languages of the european union , providing for the right for the victims of the communication in one of these languages . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1530"> as i said before , the commission , continuing the follow-up to its communication of 14 july 1999 , is working towards the adoption of specific measures to assist the victims , particularly through the support it on to the european forum of care services envisaged victims . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1531"> we take note of it . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1532"> i believe that the institutions , and in this case the commission , should work with more serious for that the proposals to this house in time and for , and delivered to being able , at the rapporteur &apos; , to examine the commission &apos;s proposal to table the amendments , have a debate in committee , and then we can discuss in plenary . we are being asked to do everything in one plenary session , which is not possible . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1533"> we did not care of the budgetary objectives to which we submitted our policy . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1534"> the constantly campaigned most tormented throughout the budgetary procedure , so it was in the financing of our external action . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1535"> to what is happening in the case or what i will follow what is needed , as general rapporteur of parliament and the council presidency , which will return to belgium in the second half of next year and wish , already a great pleasure in the negotiations . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1536"> i would also like to state clearly that we have in this parliament a number of vacant posts which , year after year , enables savings amounting to tens of millions of euros , so that we must ask ourselves if we have on our budget properly . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1537"> another reason for tackling this subject on its knees , perhaps owing to the attitude of certain members of this house who seem to know whether to want to comply blindly instructions reform of the council in detail . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1538"> the first point of agreement between the council and parliament concerns the external action , i.e. category 4 of the budget , for which our institutions shared a common goal , i.e. reconnoitring substantial funding , for the european regions in the balkans in 2001 , taking account of recent developments in the political situation in serbia , and this without the other geographical external action six priority areas have to pay for it . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1539"> finally , an agreement was reached on 23 november , he has produced on an increase in payment appropriations for the budget for 2001 , which is restricted to 3.5 % over the budget 2000 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1540"> similarly , it is in a manner consistent with this interinstitutional agreement that the council has left substantial margins under the ceilings on financial forecasts in 1999 , in particular for categories 3 , internal policies - and on heading 4 - external actions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1541"> i hope that it can act quickly . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1542"> the court has recently confirmed in a special relationship - something that has been reached this target , that the resources the cohesion fund are being properly used . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1543"> with regard to specific cases of application that we have seen during the past two years , i.e. kosovo or serbia , mobilising the flexibility instrument in enabling us to finance expenditure exceptional by making an effort of the ordinary . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1544"> whereas the us companies perceive three times that amount of aid and that a country , of course , such as turkey is spending more than 10 % of the state budget to agriculture and horticulture in mind , this means that europe wants to achieve everything sans nothing pay . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1545"> the emphasis is on what goes out rather than the goes in . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1546"> the fish , commissioner , is a fundamental part of any healthy diet , balanced and which is rich in protein . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1547"> we think it is absolutely essential that we bear in mind that this progress report is designed to restore the confidence of our citizens in the functioning of the european union institutions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1548"> after a long period of conflict and war , during which our continent was acting perfectly resolved , it is important for the balkan people should know this : when it comes to implement the reconstruction work , they can also count on us . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1549"> it will damage the interinstitutional agreement . i have to tell you that next year we will examine it in detail if we can still accept that . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1550"> with the commitment of the standing of the flexibility reserve , then that is the transparency of the budget which is suffering , and in the long term , this will lead to a loss of credibility . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1551"> i stand here before you , who represent the peoples of europe , to present a matter of priority the results of the intergovernmental conference on the reforms of the institutions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1552"> the number of areas in which the vote will be carried out by qualified majority vote was , i know , that is seen by the parliament as a priority of these negotiations . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1553"> i note too that the igc has meant that an extension of powers and scope of the european parliament . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1554"> the last six months , it is also in the area of growth and jobs that europe has progressed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1555"> two months ago , the ministers for education adopted an action plan for mobility , a plan of 42 measures , and we agreed to receive substantial amount of eur 400 million for the programme which is so important for the media plus cinema and audiovisual sector , and whom , as you know , the whole profession expectations 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1556"> it is now up to the swedish presidency - for which i would remind you that the environment is one of the priorities too - to bring the second package of proposals , which includes the establishment of a european maritime safety agency . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1557"> ec military arm , the european union will use it in complete harmony with the machinery to nato and , if necessary , with the support of those . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1558"> france had gone before , that in fact been paying particular attention . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1559"> furthermore , in your speech at the beginning of the summit , you said that parliament judge the success of nice not only quantitatively but also in terms of quality . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1560"> in response to this desire of citizens , we asked for the double majority , which is the only instrument that is objective , comprehensible and which is largely shared by the small and large member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1561"> madam president , mr president-in-office of the european council , president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , the summit has finally reached an outcome . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1562"> how can the union made its decision on a constitutional nature , in passing three sleepless nights victims of this disaster ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1563"> madam president , mr president-in-office of the council , president of the commission , i pick up the background , with regard to a famous doctor french entitled self-persuasion and has formulated a method - autosuggestion , founded on the principle of autosuggestion and private acquisition autoconviction yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1564"> that apart , what a cruel demonstration of the crisis , not just for our institutions but at a deeper crisis of identity in the construction of europe in the face of the issues involved trojan faced by the european union pact ! 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1565"> modern technology is fort consummate simple one ; repel always shelved the burden of proof , and take decisions that are devoid of content , or of applicability to places further afield and ultimately to be presenting the just like in a remarkable success . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1566"> it too , are not happy with just about all the world , starting with the small countries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1567"> the interests and of differences in the council would have avoided the debates on the number of commissioners which cling each state . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1568"> thank you , mr hager is correct . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1569"> that is where we have to be a contradiction ... 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1570"> before the vote on amendment no 22 : 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1571"> thus , the use on children is covered sometimes of revenue is individual , so it is necessary to empirical promote among of pharmaceutical companies , the development of products which are specifically designed for children and their ills so that the doses and forms pharmaceutical are well adapted to their own systems . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1572"> in practice , the period for the summer has turned into the period of normality . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1573"> but when i came back from italy , mr newens , mr fatuzzo , who told me tillich vacancier carlo fatuzzo , for making a new identity cards and a new licence document , i had to make that statement to the police and the carabinieri italians . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1574"> madam president , i wholeheartedly support this report on improving the protection of victims of crime , which once again demonstrates the eu &apos;s commitment to combating crime and in protecting our citizens . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1575"> according to my sources , it needs to be extradited to russia . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1576"> results hopeless to parliament : the refusal to allow broaden seriously deliberations by majority , the denial of parliament to codecision . i say this in passing , the establishment of the composition sans for parliament to be shocking even consulted about the composition . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1577"> the decisions concerning the vote on the council and the seats in parliament should have been taken casino cannes and no to the acropolis of nice , with mr chirac , in the role of croupier en . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1578"> it seems that the negotiators swedes have claimed several main goal is to please the large states to fight to retain their own influence to bear . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1579"> the nice treaty contains a number of important measures towards a european union as an elite as several measures designed to increase the distance between the union of democracies and the citizens . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1580"> that is why , in future , to make progress on this continent , we must have a method , states that an intergovernmental conference was based on a convention , in which the members of parliament , and not the authorities , have the last word . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1581"> that is our commitment , president prodi , commissioner barnier . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1582"> as regards the european parliament , only the commission has stood up for the legitimacy , which i thank president prodi and commissioner barnier . they were , sadly only ones , something that has nothing to do with the compromise at the end . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1583"> it was not in agreement that a bad agreement &apos; , who asked the french presidency , before the nice summit , and this morning , if i understood correctly , we were told &apos; better a bad agreement that no agreement at all . &quot; 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1584"> but the failure of historic importance of nice is that , behind the decisions , it is a lack of vision for a union consisting of 27 states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1585"> the claim of the national governments to give us a constitution to europe has now finally collapsed . the hope that the heads of state and government to consider themselves to the defenders of the idea of european unification has definitely been a failure . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1586"> the gaps old ones were not realised , and some others have been added 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1587"> mr president , i would first like to associate myself , i , too , in the praise you have just made to mr brok and mr tsatsos . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1588"> i would like to begin again merely some of the critics , or of the lessons that i have heard , on occasion . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1589"> i honestly believe that the system in that way have i e not pretend that it is clear and readable â€“ is a balanced system . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1590"> that is what i will refer to this debate , the presidency , and also of the intergovernmental conference . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1591"> with regard to the treaty of nice , there is little to say , because we have not yet the european council conclusions and , consequently , we will not be able to add anything until we shall see them do not . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1592"> furthermore , the treaty is a mixture of loose ends not satisfactory and well , in terms not satisfactory , but better than â€˜ business as usual , i assume that , at least as regards the extension of qualified majority voting , the extension of the codecision procedure for the european parliament and the provisions on closer cooperation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1593"> there is the fact that the european parliament has no part in the context of reinforced cooperation , when some of the leaders of different national parties - including that of the labour party in his speech in warsaw â€“ had been promised that the desired amendments to any structural fund reform , in real terms , until 2013 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1594"> mr president , president of the commission , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , from the winners and losers of nice , but europe , has certainly not in the ranks of the winners , nor will the democratic and transparent . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1595"> things cannot be allowed to happen . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1596"> the outermost regions deserve better , and parliament will continue , with the aid with which i am sure that commissioner barnier , for us to work flat out for their right to take their rightful place within the union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1597"> &quot; we have managed to keep things in hand &apos; or &quot; we have succeeded in blocking decisions european-led &apos; then racontent-ils into their own countries . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1598"> this is regrettable , and the very encouraging sign is that the european commission has made it was later found confidence . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1599"> the debate is closed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1600"> mr president , i would first of all that it be noted that the budget of this year has been due , above all to the work of all the members of the commission and of course , that the work of the president , mr wynn , who has so wisely leadership various situations that we have experienced , including any tense situations . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1601"> the member states at that time were not concerned their citizens and widening , spain and portugal , has come to be accompanied by a sizeable mobilisation of resources . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1602"> the approval of a supplementary and amending budget is essential , and , therefore , the potential savings is reduced to being more concerned about it consistently , if not in its entirety . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1603"> there was no more of a qualified majority in this parliament to come back to article 272 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1604"> then , when i found that there was no debate about article 25 of the iia , i was rather disappointed , and that word is weak . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1605"> however , the european parliament cannot continually adjustments to its commitments in external affairs . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1606"> we are using to 1.06 % of gross national product of member states , which also creates the more important than ever before , and the more so than was foreseen in berlin , a little less than two years .

<p><seg id="1607"> in the field of environment policy , we cannot go into the establishment of minimum rules , applied to an abandonment of confined spaces , useful if they outlined , but also on the funding will be constantly and a-critique may institutions , whose work does not work particularly noteworthy , as is the case , for example , in my opinion , to the european environment agency in copenhagen . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1608"> firstly , regarding the structure of the 2001 budget : it has been said that the agriculture budget has increased heed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1609"> i think it is a good thing to have been able to activate all the same the flexibility instrument and provide the necessary aid to serbia , even though i fully agree with you that we should get round to the situation in a flexible instrument itinerant across europe , through the various countries and regions , and that is used every time the need arises , can never become a strategic plan . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1610"> i expect a more in-depth debate in this house is taking place next month as part of the topical and urgent debate and i am proposing that only a limited extent in this debate in the resolutions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1611"> several areas can be defined in which the areas of agreement can be found , for example in the balkans , in the caucasus and central asia . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1612"> this is a resource which happens in many cases very for out of play as a second thought to major conflicts . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1613"> it underlines the importance of the strategy with russia and the importance of your report , mr oostlander . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1614"> energy policy , which is related to the policy of the major powers , is an important area of cooperation . one example is the problem of the are transporting oil and gas from east to west . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1615"> a member of my party , a radical militant journalist , was murdered a few weeks ago in tbilisi , town , on a mandate from the russian forces . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1616"> it proposes , for the northern dimension , a budget heading and defends an overall increase in aid for russia . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1617"> as of this interest , the union has developed its own areas of activity in many areas , both in its common strategy towards russia and in the other documents . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1618"> in the explanatory statement , you read in item jj &quot; whereas , russia constitution-building with belarus , a political union , it is important for the democratic legitimacy of russia , that president putin and the russian government to make clear and determined condemnation of the urgent need of reform and progress of democracy in belarus , in view of amongst other things the report that was submitted in minsk on 16 october 2000 , by the parliamentary troika of the european union , the council of europe and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1619"> the widespread &apos; nordic dimension is receiving from this proposal , an appropriation own budget , which is a very important indeed . as for myself , i propose that the energy issues are to become the driving force of this important project . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1620"> other areas where we are trying to support the effort of cooperation between the european union in relation to russia are the rule of law and the consolidation of democracy , civil society , the true , regional cooperation and across national borders and , above all , the initiative , which several members have talked about . nida 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1621"> a brief word on kaliningrad . tropospheric pca offer us an institutional framework for our dialogue with russia in matters of commerce , on visas and long-term health disorders ex-commuters . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1622"> by applying of requirements which are more favourable in the field of visas for the inhabitants of secessionist regions or by en exempting completely , at last , you would support , the legitimacy of their regimes . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1623"> the question was : there have been cases where this directive has not been followed up . if gmos have been bandied about in the environment . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1624"> i fear that we adopt it at that , within a substantive debate that we have no time to deal with here . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1625"> the council remains deeply concerned about the situation in chechnya , the violence continues , the humanitarian situation remains extremely worrying for the inclusion of the winter . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1626"> the french presidency , can she relay thors was contacting mr nielson , calling for it with some haste to travel very rapidly in chechnya ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1627"> one i have given is not , because you see is that the house is certainly not going to be full . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1628"> mr president , i believe that the question is sufficiently precise . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1629"> you are right that combating fraud is never sufficiently developed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1630"> nevertheless , i think the proposal presented by the french presidency is totally unacceptable , and it did in fact only one aim : to maintain the highest number of asylum seekers outside of the eu , which in essence , threatens to result in an increase in illegal immigration . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1631"> last month , when i asked a supplementary question during question time . this fact president-in-office had wellnigh dodged saying : â€˜ i can only repeat my earlier answer , &quot; and he then re-read his response . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1632"> i can assure all the members of parliament which made me put questions that the council will take account of their comments . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1633"> the council , for all these decisions , is attempting to restore consumer confidence in the european union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1634"> you know , we are acting at all times in the state of knowledge , and therefore i cannot entirely be doing irate that analysis . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1635"> these are the initiatives that the council has taken or intends to take towards the algerian authorities . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1636"> with regard to your second question , the council fully shares the view of the secretary-general of the united nations to be involved in this exercise , in all the institutions in question and of experts , or bodies research or academic institutions who have the kind of interest to the question of children . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1637"> the presidency is very pleased with this outcome , which marks an important step in implementing the pre-accession strategy turkish defined last year in helsinki . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1638"> the guarantees which the author of this question refers may arise from the right of every accused to defend itself itself or the assistance of a defender of his choice and , if we cannot afford to pay a supporter , they can be assisted by a lawyer to office if gratuitously the interests of justice so dictates , conditioning by policies gratuitously d an interpreter , if it does not understand or does not speak the language used during the hearing to be considered within a reasonable period of time , european free alliance ; or released during the procedure . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1639"> thus , as claimed by the council in a previous reply , the programme of mutual recognition must be nothing less than make any improvements in the field of fundamental rights . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1640"> the decision to send out an operation would take , in principle , the form of a joint action . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1641"> the honourable member &apos;s question concerns the opinions expressed informally by the president of the commission . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1642"> mr president , it gives me great satisfaction that i am presenting today , at the plenary of the european parliament a report on the stabilisation and association of croatia , with the european union . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1643"> the european union has just made on at the zagreb summit on 24 november . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1644"> i do not see any contre-indication acquainted with the development of relationships between the european union and croatia and the individual countries in the balkans and to develop at the same time a regional cooperation , on the other . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1645"> the issue must be subject to different conditions , namely that access to asylum croatia must fulfil legal international standards and be held under humane conditions . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1646"> there is , unfortunately , also had some serious jump at the durban recapture yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1647"> we are hoping to substantial progress to be made in these negotiations and to be able to be concluded soon . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1648"> i know that the croatian government is keen that the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process are judged on an individual basis , depending on their own merits . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1649"> certainly , in many respects , the hardest remains to be done , but i have no doubt the ability of people in that country to meet the challenge , to tread the difficult road of reforms , the road which is open to them and which leads to europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1650"> the problem that the government is facing is very evident in the regions which , under the khmer suharto were used - as areas of land to migration , in order to tackle the problem of overpopulation and exploited like territories captured by the adfl . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1651"> the eu should do likewise . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1652"> our main concerns lie and we expect a response from the european commission to these developments . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1653"> but the level of the cooperation should take into account the actual progress made by the country in the resolution of regional problems and the methods being developed , respect for human rights and also the cooperation that the country is to a positive development of the process of independence of east timor , particularly in relation to the rules on issues that faces the refugees in west timor , when assessing and condemning the members of the militias which are guilty of criminal activities and which have murdered recently three officials of the united nations . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1654"> the revolution in the country and the way in which it found itself , still remain the bedrock of guarded optimism . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1655"> admittedly , the soldiers , have less influence , but they always have the odds . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1656"> mrs maij-weggen , has produced an excellent report , and i would like , therefore , like when i say that europe must do everything in its power to support the country on the road to democracy , but it is up to the indonesians themselves that it is up to get rid of the regime suharto . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1657"> it mentions , in fact , by name , very frankly , the forces opposed to the essentials and demanding processes of reform . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1658"> any external action other than support for democratisation and the rule of law can only be seen as counterproductive and inflammatory all round . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1659"> it goes without saying that since then , there do did not end there , and 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1660"> only two years ago , then it was still being ruled by an authoritarian leader who is supported by armed forces . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1661"> the debate is closed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1662"> this one has been partly out of date and the summit in nice is no change to the situation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1663"> nevertheless , there are differing views on how this human rights protection can be guaranteed . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1664"> mr president , i can be brief because this is not the first discussion on this subject . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1665"> we do not believe that increased solutions at community level can improve the fight against crime in that our efforts will be characterised by all the more so because of indifference , of carelessness and de secretiveness administrations overall eu yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1666"> in my view , the european public prosecutor is merely a first step along the path to corpus juris , a body that is common law for the whole of europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1667"> we are wasting enormous sums of money which is quite simply because they are not perceived by the member states . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1668"> you know , the commission would have preferred that olaf be created as a government totally independent . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1669"> we must not forget that this is the reservations of parliament to give its assent to the way that taxpayers &apos; money had been spent , in 1996 , which triggered the fall of the commission in 1999 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1670"> we depend upon the court , which provides us with the weapons with which draw on areas of darkness . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1671"> . ( fr ) we doing our utmost to monitor it properly . the commission and the member states , and this report is an effort in this direction . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1672"> mr president , may i begin by welcoming the opportunity of this initiative and the speed with which our rapporteur mrs eluned morgan has carried it out . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1673"> we must be able to judge whether the situation is improving or exacerbated . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1674"> indeed , the commission retains always read the information and failed to answer some questions , in particular as regards the flÃ©chard case . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1675"> i am sure the house would wish her all hoping and praying for success in this , although i fear , that â€˜ discharge &quot; and &quot; &apos; are always among the first words issue an opinion baby . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1676"> i would respond also to mrs stauner , who has raised some of the specific questions that this agreement stipulates that requests of confidential information to be asked or transferred to the commission by the president of the committee . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1677"> once again , congratulations on your report . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1678"> seen as part of a directive that are their shareholders must be given a fair price about as much of an effect except to say that an apple when it is mature graves of either the trees . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1679"> for this reason i can only invite the house to approve the compromise amendments tabled by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1680"> in order to be effective , valuable and in the public interest , such a directive should : first , to avoid the direct involvement of the courts in him preferring a regulatory body endowed with a very vast discretion under the rule of law ; secondly , our own rules on jurisdiction and clarify , for that would use them ; and thirdly , make it clear what is meant by fair price and to set thresholds appropriate ; fourthly , to take care that the management should be able to prevent it , wrongly , the shareholders of taking decisions which they believe they must take on the future of the society in which they hold . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1681"> it is true that the regulation of the european parliament does not offer this option , when making those discussions will be a mere , pure deaf ears . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1682"> thirdly , clear : the lack of clarity is particularly evident in the debate on the court of law , an area in which i have some experience . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1683"> the european institutions openly disregarded of redundancies and closures of companies caused by almost all of the takeovers or mergers of undertakings . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1684"> furthermore , if we open the door on defensive measures , mr president , perhaps more difficult , the restructuring of the european markets , particularly the protection of small shareholders . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1685"> neither the community law or the national legislation of several member states have at the moment , a compulsory system under the laws on acquisition of undertakings . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1686"> mr president , i would like to thank parliament for the attention it devotes to the proposal , together with the committee on legal affairs , in particular the rapporteur - as mr lehne â€“ for the work they have done . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1687"> the first one is in fact only the owners and the second point relates to only about the supervisory authority . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1688"> the third part is not acceptable to the same reasons as those that apply to all the amendments that the so-called &apos; social &apos; . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1689"> this is an unacceptable situation on the european market , as being incompatible with the requirements of the internal market . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1690"> there has been some misunderstanding on the basis , because we believe that the use of corporations collective management will be compulsory , as is currently the case in austria . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1691"> the socialist group has thus been that parliament may dÃ©considÃ¨re &apos;t by agreeing to the proposals that ridiculisent votes that took place in the first reading . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1692"> the opinions on the resale right ne tread no border in the political groups . it is up to the member state level . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1693"> this is intellectual property against the principle of retaliation . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1694"> in any event , in the name of what should we impose a tax on the resale of the table , and does not do the same , for the benefit of the manufacturer or the generalised lindh , for a car or a toeing sold at second hand ? 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1695"> for these same reasons . amendment no 4 and the part of amendment no 7 which is linked to this issue must also be rejected . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1696"> discussions about a very important subject at a time when we do not yet have in our own mother tongue of the amendments tabled at the last minute , and amendments before the committee that i think is quite impossible . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1697"> this should therefore be an exception , if we hold a debate without a copy of the amendments . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1698"> we have agreed within the commission to keep up the issue of special services such as that for which was endorsed by the directive no 67 / 97 . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1699"> madam president , i could also make a lot of things , but i will now confine myself to saying that there have rarely been such a political consensus between the various committees of this parliament called upon to give their opinion on a problem . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1700"> of this is our responsibility . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1701"> however , my group shares the view that we must take care of course , the same time , as a community and as member states to define a framework for a universal service . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1702"> and yet , we are supposed to adhere to the commission &apos;s proposals that have not even have access to these studies . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1703"> we are often simply here to represent the citizens of europe . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1704"> . ( fr ) we emboÃ®tons the step to the monopolies . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1705"> furthermore , there is reference to the 1997 directive . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1706"> i shall be very clear on one particular point . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1707"> while the electronic communications that we in this ; it , the former monopolies state-run remain chiefly turned to the interior . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1708"> there is a link between all these things . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1709"> i give my support to the limit set at 150 grams for reasons of caution . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1710"> i am not an adversary a priori of the market or liberalisation . but this request , namely an analysis be undertaken in good order qualified non precipitate and considering all the consequences , was not satisfied , and that is why the compromise now before us is for me to be admissible . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1711"> fortunately we have a directive which requires transparency , on the part of public enterprises and i can assure you that the subsidies thugs , examined carefully . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1712"> i think that you have understood nothing , and it does not look as if you listened to the arguments which you have been tabled . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1713"> users will be the losers , with employees , and the competitiveness and growth european-led rÃ©gresseront yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1714"> the liberalisation being proposed will not go without causing a major impact on the services provided in the countryside , on the workers in the sector and on the users dailies post . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1715"> it is regrettable that the commission chose sheer headlong , according for with a proposal which does not take into account the views of certain interest groups in the population . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1716"> this sector is suffering from fierce competition of these new technologies . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1717"> invoking realism as with the broad left in an attempt to find a compromise solution with a part of the right is being eroded conceal his own capitulation before private interests . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1718"> this figure is largely sufficient to support the public service tasks , like a universal right route , and a uniform tariffs . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1719"> i have nothing to learn from the labour party , upon respect of rural areas . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1720"> mr president , i should like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr ferber , who has not had an easy task , that is the least we can say . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1721"> this is a decision you regretterez yalta did . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1722"> mr president , in view of the discussions that preceded it , the commission is aware of how important this subject in the eyes of parliament ; i have also looked with great attention the many amendments to the draft directive . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1723"> in short , this will be good enough and the power to arrive on time and to halt the momentum of change , if necessary , a fact , be seriously damaging the adjustments that are under way and a threat to employment in the long term . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1724"> first of all the blame lies for posts to britain â€™ , john , who has pointed out that competition roberts results in the standards of quality and efficiency as well as a reduction in prices . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1725"> a monopoly on postal services is threatening to grind these and of causing loss of volumes , which , in turn , will lead to a drop in employment . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1726"> we must nurture the momentum of change that is under way , start up in practice , the first step in the process and set a timetable of reforms to come . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1727"> i note that the postal services can help us to heat up the atmosphere in the chamber and i am pleased to say . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1728"> the report proposes , amongst other things , the rejection of moving on to &apos; tariff only , a tariff preference for the acp that eur 300 â€“ a minimum , an evaluation and a possible revision of the practices of the com . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1729"> otherwise , our position remains therefore of the same : to date of implementation of the system are kept for at least ten years in order to guarantee legal certainty for manufacturers and operators , re-examination those ten years , not a case of moving on to &apos; tariff only wuori tariff preference of 300 euros for the acp countries . we require guarantees , should the system of management of quotas &apos; first come , which was the first served &apos; would be set up by the commission , because it will have serious repercussions on the acp producers , who are unable to be taken today has a place in the race to vessels which is soon to be initiated . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1730"> mr schwaiger has said to you , in the previous debate , that you have to gather information complementing more advantage of the different views on the problem . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1731"> the implementation of the compromise that is taken , which is part of the standards of the wto , must be analysed by the european commission in a report that parliament will have to study at a reasonable time period ; at the point of view of the extent of the report and its conclusions , it will be necessary to propose new measures , as the rapporteur stresses in his work . 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1732"> mr president , to observers perplexed like me , we move from a strange place at the drop of in this matter . from this surrealism 
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1733"> the powerful forces resist that .

<p><seg id="1735"> mr president , i would like to stress , firstly , the endeavours of the european parliament , which is trying to achieve a balanced solution for worldwide complicated weave of interests and a fall in market organization .
