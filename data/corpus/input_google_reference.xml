<p><seg id="37"> the challenge of reunification, more than the expansion probably is so huge that it invades or surrounds all parliamentary debates. that explains the depth and intensity that emerged from our discussions, including this morning&apos;s debate on the need to prepare for this extraordinary challenge.

<p><seg id="47"> set no date can arouse disappointment, setting too early date may lead to some complacency: this means that we look at the question of when the right time to know when we can say with sufficient certainty how time any country will be ready for membership or not.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="48"> we already have very much.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="49"> before i was born, freedom and democracy had precedence over oppression and madness of war, and a european union was formed.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="63"> mr. chairman, mr. commissioner, your rapporteur shares the opinions of the report of the committee on slovenia and finds that criticism in 1998 constituted a salutary shock to the slovenian authorities, who have since responded by accelerating the adoption of measures necessary for accession.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="64"> the perpetuation of the status quo, after the turkish invasion of july-august 1974, n is not acceptable to the european union.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="68"> let me address some of the priority items.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="69"> that is why we can us to be honest, develop constantly new challenges in these areas.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="70"> fundamentally, however, we must consider one thing: the remarkable efforts and the absolute will of candidate countries&apos; expanding join the european union should be motivation enough for us to prepare ourselves for this enlargement.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="71"> mr. chairman, we may tend to think that the accession of new member states automatically assume that they must meet higher standards for the protection of the environment and nature.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="72"> mr. chairman, when pandora opened the box, all the evils of mankind were released.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="73"> that is why my report devotes a large part of its recommendations to the need to encourage the flagship program to do more in the field of health and get countries to cooperate now under action programs health and other sectors.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="74"> we must begin to talk about integrated and polycentric european development.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="75"> we heard something on the theme of the core with respect to the area of policy and regional promotion.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="76"> there are a number of other points raised by the committee on regional policy in its report.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="77"> to avoid that the same scenario is repeated, it is essential to ensure that enlargement is not only beneficial to men but also to women.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="78"> that minds are more weighted is no more than a proof - i have warned previously in the same terms colleagues from central europe - we passed the honeymoon normal household reality.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="79"> the results of the intergovernmental conference depend unavoidable conditions that the european union could undertake its enlargement.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="81"> various reports reflect this mainstream.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="82"> barely out of your old prison, n &apos;not enter a new one.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="83"> i think precisely that already going too fast to six and fifteen, we have demonstrated our inability to build a europe that respects differences of its first members.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="84"> we will see an increase in competition and an acceleration of the reform process, including western europe.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="85"> at various stages, however, measures were taken during and after world war ii, which obviously did not meet the criteria of copenhagen as the spirit that prevailed at the time, but what that in any case, it&apos;s about these laws was developed the ideological and political architecture of this period, including peace treaties.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="86"> for all these reasons, and therefore our own experience in greece, our opposition to the enlargement of the european union is an expression of fraternal solidarity in respect of workers and, in general, peoples and candidates for membership.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="87"> it is imperative that the accession negotiations between romania and the european union detail exactly what the romanian government needs to improve the standards and quality of orphanages in the country.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="90"> poos the report stresses that democracy, cyprus, works perfectly, because the respect of human rights and freedoms are the cornerstone of social and cultural traditions of the island, and the structures social of the country are clearly centered on the human person.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="91"> the visual is very important.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="256"> it goes without saying that we do not pretend to harmonizing legislation to protect minors, not only because, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, each member state is sovereign in the matter, but also because the cultural and moral conceptions and therefore, assessments of these themes differ considerably from one country to another. it n &apos;is, for example, no single definition of the concept of a minor, violence, etc..

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="259"> let me tell you, in conclusion, the concern of the liberal group compared to the increasing availability of television programs involving violence and sex.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="260"> it is therefore essential that all parties involved, starting with the children through their parents, educators, countries, the european union, to finish with broadcasters and program producers to consult on this topic and learn how to behave and react to these proposals and the impact that they can have on people.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="285"> it&apos;s really very annoying that these women who, from their kitchen, or accounts of their household refuse the bright future of the euro.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="286"> however, the report that is before us is based on a strained interpretation of the principle of equality.
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="294"> it&apos;s obvious, and associative i am - because i too, like many of you, i have an associative journey of thirty years - knows how associative movements, feminist movements, movements intellectuals, of course, worked to advance this subject, and we, today, we are at our place in our part of responsibility, an institutional role.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="299"> i think, once again, the conciliation procedure, the agreement between the institutions worked well.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="300"> the community customs code has enabled to harmonize and simplify legislation seamlessly - which should always be the ultimate goal.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="301"> if one considers the delicate balance that characterizes the record, i think that the outcome of a conciliation procedure - assuming that this debate be extended - would rather uncertain.

<p><seg id="302"> mr. chairman, on the last vote, i just want to inform the meeting that the committee released yesterday, a press release and that commissioner reding s is expressed yesterday evening so that, as regards report that we have just passed on the mobility of teachers, students, teachers and members of the educational community in general, report to help them travel in europe to study, work or any activity related to field of education, board n &apos;accept any amendments asking him to do anything to ensure that these agreements are respected.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="303"> mr. chairman, it s&apos; also is a mistranslation that n does not have the same scope as that which has just been raised.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="306"> our position on the recommendation of the european parliament and the council about the free movement within the union is positive in principle, but we want to discuss the following:
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="307"> it should be integrated into association agreements which have been concluded or to be concluded between the european union and candidate rules that prohibit discrimination protected by the country group article 13.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="308"> the usual principles of the rule of law are thus gradually changed under the influence of an extremist conception of the fight against discrimination, which the european parliament and the commission are too happy to join in order to their noses in all national laws.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="309"> it seemed essential to broaden the scope of the program to ensure the implementation of article 13 of the treaty.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="310"> in addition, the snp sees this directive as a means to achieve the underlying objectives of the european union in recognizing that equality in employment helps to fight against social exclusion and participates in the , increased mobility of citizens within the union.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="315"> although we felt some sympathy over the idea of a political regulation of european production and export of armaments, we are skeptical with regard to the titley report, primarily for the following reasons:
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="316"> i support the report by my colleague, gary titley and considers him responsible business practices in the field of armaments are part of the acquis communautaire, and that, therefore, the candidate countries should be involved in developing the code of conduct on arms exports, code of conduct should be legally binding.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="416"> given the current level of economic integration, financial and monetary, the probability that one or the other member state encounters difficulties related to the balance of payments is extremely reduced from an institutional point of view, but the mechanism should remain in force.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="423"> that is where your legal error, madam chair.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="424"> in the social field, i think we should also be able to advance, provided, however, not to touch the principles that the various national social security schemes, which leaves some room for maneuver.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="428"> it is for us an essential criterion for the outcome of the intergovernmental conference to be qualified as a success, that the decision to become the most basic decision in the future within the council of ministers and the european parliament is treated as an equal in terms of legislation in these various materials.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="429"> but there is a basic question that i would ask the president of the board to clarify.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="430"> in this sense, i would also ask that we clearly decide on the proposal that we do that, we believe, has a political meaning.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="431"> this implies that the majority decision rule becomes the board, as well as co-decision of the parliament should be the rule in the field of agriculture, for example.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="432"> i also wish success nice and i am pleased that the european populations and many associations, ngos or trade unions, s&apos; invest in nice perspective.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="433"> we already know this model in the framework of the cooperation policy of justice.

<p><seg id="435"> i would also return the number of members of the european parliament.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="436"> how, in these circumstances, can we imagine that there is a change on it?

<p><seg id="437"> that is why i believe that the resolution that we will vote tomorrow, we outsource a very clear mandate to our two representatives, elmar brok and dimitris tsatsos, allowing them to present a proposal in this direction on the nice table.

<p><seg id="438"> friserions us, it seems to me ridiculous. i hope that progress by nice may be made on this point.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="439"> unfortunately, the more france is the interpreter of his own interests and those of the major countries that proposals could overcome the differences, although m. moscovici is now trying to convince us otherwise.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="440"> i must tell you that article 93, as that is formulated by the presidency, does not answer a simple enough debate.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="441"> if the eu treaty agreed at nice completely alleviates the influence and representation of smaller member states, it will be very difficult to defend and approval in referendums in these three countries.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="443"> the enlargement of vision that he had for some has become a scarecrow, as if he was going to make changes in the balance of power.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="444"> it is really disturbing that those who do not want to push reforms further than they are authorized the mandate from their member states are subject to that can be called a kind of blackmail.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="445"> mr. chairman, during the plenary session last september, we have lived and shared moments of optimism and hope with abraham burg, president of the knesset, and abu ala, speaker of the palestinian legislative council.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="446"> i believe that it is right that we issue again today a joint resolution on behalf of all parties, in which we agree, wisely, that the two parties must make peace, that we can not do as peoples.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="447"> we are a force of opposition and i think we have the right to pass resolutions in favor of the charter, different from those of the majority.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="448"> this procedure is unacceptable from the point of view of democracy and political integration.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="452"> finally, i would like to thank ms. randzio-plath for intervention that it has done everything at the time.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="457"> so now i come on each of these points, but briefly to allow time for our discussion.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="458"> i would just say thank you to olive, and simply underline that there is, in his text, an attack quite low against the president prodi - he speaks with humor, of course - or even notice that it n &apos; , not quite say how he wished that one reaches the constitution.

<p><seg id="459"> then, there are, again, it&apos;s inevitable, but nevertheless questionable, a degree of arbitrariness, understandably, in the choices made by the institute of florence.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="460"> i understand that our italian friends - many of them - are between the different language versions of article 158, paragraph 2 of the treaty, certain nuances or differences, which can lead to different interpretations.

<p><seg id="461"> i fully share the desire of parliament that the fundamentals are not changed, but i have noted, mr. chairman gil-robles, opening your hand to relax some of these conditions, that is the point 11 of your resolution and i want, in this respect, show some caution.

<p><seg id="1135"> mr. chairman, it is certain that we are in a phase where sexospécifités, the participation of women, begin to appear in the various programs, when they do not become the rule.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1136"> so i think these two means are taken into consideration to achieve a universal study of the problem and examine the attempts deployed in some countries.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1137"> in some cases, they are exploited and abused.

<p><seg id="1138"> i&apos;ll review some of the objections.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1147"> my objective throughout the writing of this report was to put forward a proposal that is politically mature, eminently reasonable and practical, both for institutions and citizens.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1148"> another important amendment is the one about the proposal to include in the regulation not only the board, commission and parliament as well as all external bodies.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1149"> it&apos;s also a very good thing that the institutions are imposed, or rather that they are given the opportunity to disclose documents also to those which do not live on the territory of the european union or who are not citizens of the european union.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1153"> mr. chairman, the cashman report can be summarized in a few words: the power of citizens of bureaucracy.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1156"> according what is said, the regulation on access to documents has hardly been addressed in the college and there was considered until now as an essentially administrative matter.

<p><seg id="1158"> we, members of the bonino list, we consider at the same time that we should not fall into the opposite extreme by imposing a hyper-regulation would introduce an indiscriminate access to information or opinions n &apos;have no intelligence value.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1168"> at this stage of the legislative process, it is premature to take a position on the desirability of a direct relationship between the classification and access to documents, as proposed by amendment 29, or the inclusion in this regulation standards for this purpose.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1407"> i would add that the initiative of the commission to present this position was important because it played like a sword of damocles, as an effective pressure on the omi in order to succeed.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1408"> on the other hand, inspections will be taxed only when they can be made by exclusive and specialized inspectors can not have any link with the owner, and that he does not control the body vessel&apos;s classification.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1507"> madam president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i see once again that the advantages and disadvantages of summer time lead to further discussion.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1508"> our group believes that the proposal is to be made good. he supports and believes that new amendments are not necessary.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1511"> according to the european parliament, the compromises that we made we agree significantly improve the common position of the council.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1512"> children receive medications that have only been tested on adults, which means that children are treated badly.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1513"> it can help to improve clinical research in europe and therefore the well-being of millions of patients.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1514"> this compromise, which of course can still be outdone by each member state sets a minimum threshold in order to avoid the appearance in the european union with a sort of dumping ethics that would make it possible to a member state, but not others, to conduct research on persons incapable of giving consent.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1515"> finally, and in this regard i extend my displeasure that that provision has not been included in the compromise proposals of the board, i think the principal investigator responsible for the conduct of clinical trials must be doctor. because only doctors have the knowledge and experience to enable them to assess the benefits and mitigate the adverse effects and risks during these tests.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1516"> the agenda is the report (a5-0377/2000) m. trakatellis, on behalf of the committee on the environment, public health and consumer policy on the proposal for a european parliament and council extending certain programs of community action in the field of public health adopted by decisions 645/96 / it, 646/96 / it, 647/96 / the 102/97 / that, from 1400 to 1497 / and the 1296/1999 / ce and amending those decisions (com (2000) 0448 - c5- 0400/2000 - 2000/0192 (cod)).
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1517"> perhaps, i might add, we inaugurated a new mode in co-decision.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1518"> it is precisely a problem about which we think that we see the weakness of the orientation of the european union, the council and the commission, together with the budget cuts, not reach the ceiling 1 27% currently allowed by the standards, that actions like these are allowed while the coordination between member states s&apos; becomes more and more important.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1519"> it&apos;s an area that can be considered in the context of the new eu public health program to be launched soon.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1520"> the text we adopt today the extension of six public health programs reflects informal agreements between institutions.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1522"> the european union can not accept that they are given a different treatment depending on the member state where they have been victims of the offense or by nationality.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1523"> we should therefore ask ourselves if it is justified to approve this project.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1531"> we take note.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1532"> i think the institutions, and in this case the commission should work more seriously for proposals reach the meeting on time and that we can appoint a rapporteur to examine the proposal from the commission, submit amendments , debate in committee, and then discuss in plenary. you asked us to do in one plenary session, which is impossible.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1533"> we n &apos;not have the outset of fiscal targets which we submitted our policy.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1536"> i also want to say this clearly: we in this parliament a number of vacancies, from year to year, which saves money in the tens of millions of euros, so we must ask ourselves if we still establish our budget properly.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1537"> another reason to treat this theme knees may be the attitude of some members of this assembly, which seem only to want to blindly obey the instructions of the board.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1538"> the first point of agreement between the council and the parliament of external actions, that is to say iv budget item for which our institutions share a common goal, that is to say, make a substantial funding for the balkan region in 2001, given the recent developments in the political situation in serbia, and that without other geographic priorities of the external action of the union have to pay the price.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1539"> finally, an agreement was reached on november 23 with an increase in payment appropriations from the 2001 budget, limited to 3.5% over the 2000 budget.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1540"> well, that is in accordance with the iia that the board has left substantial margins in the financial perspective ceilings established in 1999, particularly sections 3 - internal policies - and for category 4 - external actions.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1541"> i hope that it can respond quickly.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1542"> the court of auditors has recently confirmed in a special report that we achieved this goal, which means the cohesion funds are properly used.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1543"> regarding specific cases of application we have known for two years, that is to say, kosovo and serbia, mobilize the flexibility instrument has funded an exceptional expense by an exceptional effort .

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1550"> with the ongoing commitment of the flexibility reserve, it&apos;s the transparency of the budget suffers, and in the long run this will lead to a loss of credibility.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1681"> it is true that the regulation of the european parliament not offered this opportunity, transforming these debates pure and simple dialogue of the deaf.

<p><seg id="1780"> mr. chairman, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal from the european commission which aims to impose vat on the purchase of digital products downloaded directly from the network by the resident consumers in union with companies from third countries is a serious blow to the development of e-commerce.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1781"> so, regarding the commission proposal to extend the timetable for reform, i can only express my neutrality.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1782"> i am opposed to the desire to harmonize the vat ms torres brands, but i would especially like to mention the ratio of m. garcía-margallo on electronic commerce.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1783"> all states redistribute at least 30 and often 40 and sometimes more than 50% of national wealth is created in the year.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1784"> should be the minimum, a maximum rate possible rate, but it should be left to states a margin to their own micro-economic policies.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1785"> personally, i have proposed an amendment on the harmonization of vat rates to correct the effects of unfair competition because, on vat rates, operators of third countries, when to register, a very large choice recording, given the significant differences - between 15 and 25% - whereas community operators n do not have that choice.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1786"> if in addition we tax unilaterally aviation fuel in europe, european companies have a really hard to stay competitive with non-european companies.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1787"> no this is not the way we organize society, and that is why i believe that it is a question of an excellent proposal.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1788"> not only air fares increase dramatically - probably 80 pounds per ticket, threatening the very existence of smaller carriers - but the damage would affect more industrial aerospace, tourism, trade, and obviously , freight carriers - they carry today one third of global air freight.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1789"> i think, as m. skinner, the proposals of the rapporteur, mr. garcía-margallo y marfil, on the vat applied to electronic commerce are good.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1790"> i would like to express only the taxation of aviation fuel.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1791"> impose a vat to suppliers mainly american third country, is not only impractical, but in the case of newspapers and books, creates inconsistencies between a product sold online and the same product sold in stores.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1792"> third point: the eu should not establish a right too hasty and should do everything in its power to strengthen the european e-commerce and not the insecure.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1793"> the results of this consultation were discussed in the ecofin council at the end of november.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1794"> a variety of details has yet to be resolved.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1795"> c is in this context that the proposal seeks to maintain the existing harmonization of vat rates confirming the minimum level of 15% for the standard rate.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1796"> however, i would like to remind that the current eu tax legislation does not permit tax only domestic and intra-eu flights.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1800"> regarding the issue of responsibility, i will simply say that the current fund is not enough to compensate all damages caused by the spill of erika.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1801"> mr. ortuondo, regarding your comments about article 6, the responsibility for minor pollution, i will first see what the council, but the parliament already has a position on the subject.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1802"> the overall objective of this legislation was to eliminate distortions of competition through the establishment of a fair mechanism impacting infrastructure costs of road hauliers and harmonize sampling systems in the internal market of the eu.
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="1810"> mr. commissioner, i feel, above all, relieved, in some way, to see that the commission has worried and, perhaps, occupied the problem.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1811"> we think it might not be the case in extending assistance to all-out operation. instead, the board must be prepared to give specific and targeted if the actions taken on his behalf by the commissioner lamy would not give results for the sector of the european union instrument.

<p><seg id="1828"> let me briefly say what is the important part of my report and the point i think that it is a key priority for this parliament, namely the issue of linguistic diversity.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1829"> it is essential that we convainquions commercial providers gains and potential investment opportunities in companies which take into account linguistic diversity and exploitation of public sector information.
</seg></p>

<p><seg id="1840"> reason for a popular party like ours, the ppe, not to let air traffic escape european regulation and also not wanting to distinguish between military and civilian air traffic.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1841"> my group does not support, however, the view of the rapporteur of wanting to fix now by this directive maximum levels of ambient noise for airports.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1842"> i therefore agree with the rapporteur roo when it proposes not to waste more time and turn this directive on the assessment and management of noise in a binding framework directive.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1843"> in another group, there would be technical problems.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1844"> it is the member states that, according to their customs, would set the duration of this period in a given range.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1845"> i am very surprised to hear one or the other to say that he daughter directives we need.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1846"> we therefore need the framework directive and a combined approach. that is why i believe that many of the decisions of the committee on the environment, public health and consumer policy is true and accurate.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1847"> no this is not what we want.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1856"> we know that the commission is preparing to present a sustainable development program for the entire european union, which should be ready in six months.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1857"> as that legislative body, we should never seek to exacerbate the conflict between town and country.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1858"> credits are primarily for networks of cities organized at european level for their activities in the development and dissemination of good practice in sustainable urban development.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1859"> moreover, in practice, that is at the local level that the decisions we make in this parliament should be implemented.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1860"> i believe that this innovative approach can be an example to be followed by others.

<p><seg id="1861"> the commission can not accept amendments 1, 3, 4, 9, 14, 17, 21, 26, 31, 38 and 39.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1863"> mr. president, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the committee on legal affairs and the internal market has raised some points on the precautionary principle, points one finds from elsewhere in the excellent report by our colleague, even country.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1864"> the public does not want to bear the brunt of hazardous technological innovations that it proves a few or many years later that they have undue risk to public health or the environment.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1865"> i am in favor of the precautionary principle. but i would like to raise one point of concern.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1866"> should keep certain themes in mind to ensure proper operation.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1867"> first, it does not exist minimum threshold below which the precautionary principle could not be upheld since, even in low-risk, it can be done using the precautionary principle.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1868"> in the amendments that i have tabled, i tried to clarify these points and remove some unnecessary parts.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1869"> it is incomprehensible that the european union remains insensitive to dozens of independent scientific studies that indicate a potential risk of mobile phones on human health.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1870"> producers and manufacturers must be able to present evidence of the safety of their products.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1871"> mr. chairman, accommodated all the sauces, depending on the circumstances and interests of the moment, the precautionary principle may be the best as the worst thing.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1872"> we consider that it is a general principle that should be considered in the areas of protection of the environment and human health, animal and plant.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1873"> thank you very much, mr. commissioner liikanen.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1874"> our european community is first and foremost a community of values based on respect for the rule of law.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1875"> we know that, personally, we are not important, but we believe that what unites us and mobilizes takes the importance, namely the rejection of criminal terrorism of eta and our unequivocal support for the rule of law spanish, today threatened by a totalitarian project of violent secession.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1876"> ladies and gentlemen, as democrats, we are obviously supporters of dialogue between the various democratic parties, because democracy itself is a permanent dialogue.

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1881"> since its inception, the cohesion fund has had a significant impact in two areas of great community interest - the environment and trans-european networks - and provided a good example of effective implementation of the eu budget and the rate of implementation of the highest of all the community budget.

<p><seg id="1885"> mr. president, i voted for this report on food additives, and in particular for the prohibition of the use of sodium alginate to keep carrots.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1886"> i suggest that you also send a copy of malta, since the only explanation of vote that no decision has not made is, i think, when we talked about malta.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1887"> so, today, i voted ferber report on &quot;european postal services&quot; it is because i think that in the current balance of forces in europe and in the european parliament, we got the best that we could get to avoid the disappearance of the public postal service in europe!
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1888"> i really regret that parliament has finished in the vote by supporting a very damaging position for consumers.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1889"> i strongly refute this false allegation.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1890"> it is not enough to advocate liberalization if we do not understand the effects of our decisions.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1891"> suede, this proposal has already been partially implemented and we can now see that it has created a worse that situation before.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1892"> we hope that the negotiations s&apos; open soon and that they will lead to an agreement consistent with the commitments we made in the framework of the wto and with the interests of our traditional suppliers.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1893"> things are very clear: i do not underestimate the importance of this organization. i refuse to others, this n &apos;is not globalization!
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1894"> second, the report deals too negatively linguistic and cultural diversity.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1895"> it is clear that europe is able to meet the challenge of the markets, with the advantages that it has on the economic and employment and, of course, with its rich cultural and linguistic diversity - that are explicitly contained in the notion of linguistic minority and regional languages - face to monolingualism which characterizes much of the &quot;network&quot;.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1896"> mr. chairman, i have asked my daughter elisabetta - which, as you know, is regional deputy pensioners party in lombardy - give me an opinion on this board nice: that she thought if she felt that i had to vote for.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1897"> it is now ready for the accession of candidate states.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1898"> maybe they will be successful, at least momentarily, but at the cost of serious drawbacks: more supranational, less democracy, heavier in germany in the decision process.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1899"> this trend may seem legitimate in the eyes of some, since it tends to translate into the respective institutions in terms of weight of country populations.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1900"> it could therefore result in more difficulties in the implementation of laws which are binding in areas of the environment, consumer protection and the working environment, and we strongly urge countries to demonstrate to a sense of responsibility and improve the effectiveness of decision-making procedures in the council.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1901"> negotiations were difficult, but the power of the union was reflected in his determination to find solutions acceptable to all.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1902"> this situation is aggravated by the widening of decisions by qualified majority, 14 countries may, under certain conditions, to make decisions on behalf of 27 or 28, since &apos;the right of veto over major political is eliminated in practice for portugal, such as the structural funds or agreements on trade policy.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1903"> we maintain unanimity in council and therefore a latent inability to act.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1904"> for our part, as europe is that it is, questions of constitutional significance or a fundamental interest for the states, such as those that have been discussed in nice, can not be resolved in another way. l must be unanimous.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1905"> this has the effect of increasing the power of large countries to the detriment of children.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1906"> these low prices are not only the result of staff reductions and other cost savings but also public policy.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1907"> &quot;&quot; then go to bed and make love.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1908"> while the realization structures are passed to a project approach to a program approach in this program - that one can already challenge, because a portion of the nearby citizens, the added value and european visibility is already lost, in my opinion, and because member states n &apos;not all created regional authorities - innovative actions under the esf maintain a project approach.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1909"> the trick is to determine which, but we also have the strength to admit that in case of failure, we should not bail them out at the expense of state and adopt a strategy that takes into account this aspect.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1910"> tourism is an important economic activity, even in some outlying areas.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1911"> it&apos;s a good value and is based on a good document of the commission.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1912"> i agree especially that the instruments of territorial policy should be oriented towards sustainability, strengthening economic and social cohesion, and, above all, the creation of skilled jobs, economically viable and sustainable.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1913"> first point: we, and the people there, consider innovative measures were a useful step for local authorities and communities that are not actually part of the structural funds, but should be included, in order to learn to manage small projects to be able to play a more effective role in the dominant programs in the years to come.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1914"> is in their way and the added value of the direct relationship between the european and the dome closer to the problems of citizens public institutions is lost.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1915"> that is why we have chosen as strategic priorities these three priorities: technological innovation, company information, but also regional identity and sustainable development.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1916"> i understand your desire to maintain direct links between the european union and the regional and local actors.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1920"> another concern regarding the sixth framework program for research and development in the project, the line &quot;marine technology&quot;, which existed in the fifth, seems today, have disappeared.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1921"> mr. chairman, at the approach of the end of the year, a debate on the situation in the shipbuilding sector seems to have become a tradition.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1922"> in recent weeks, the commission said that the grant scheme, through which our industry survives, should be deleted in january on behalf of a supposedly improving its competitiveness.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1923"> so therefore, it&apos;s the state that pays a good portion, if not the entirety, of the profits of the company.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1924"> this is because we are unable to report a situation of unfair competition.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1925"> debates within the oecd have progressed little, very little progress, and the possibility of concluding a binding international agreement in the field of shipbuilding industry seems distant.
</seg></p>

</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1935"> we all support the right to self-determination.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1936"> it is especially significant, and it&apos;s at this point that i would like to emphasize, in that it shows what state is the so-called united europe and in this respect it is almost even fun for separatists.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1937"> it is a shame that at the moment 11 nuclear submarines to attack the 12 in service in the royal navy are capitalized. four are being repaired and seven showed signs of fatigue such as those that secure the tireless hms.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1938"> the actual case is more serious than all this since it relates to the community territory, hundreds of thousands of human beings, not only spanish, obviously, but also of all nationalities, especially british.
</seg></p>
<p><seg id="1939"> i would point to return to the content of draft resolutions on the role of the commission, that the british government does not consider that the treaty is applicable euratom in military situations of this type.
